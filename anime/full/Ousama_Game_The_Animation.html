But the reason for his antisocial behavior soon becomes clear when his class receives a text from someone called &quot;The King.&quot; Included are instructions for the &quot;King&#039;s Game,&quot; and all class members must participate. Those who refuse to play, quit halfway, or don&#039;t follow an order in the allotted time of 24 hours will receive a deadly punishment. Having played the game before and watched as those around him died, Nobuaki tries to warn his clueless classmates. Unfortunately, they only believe him after the King&#039;s Game claims its first casualties. Stuck in a horrific situation with no chance of escape, Nobuaki has a choice: put his own survival above those around him, or do what he couldn&#039;t before and save his classmates.

</div><h2><div class="floatRightHeader"><a href="/dbchanges.php?aid=36027&t=synopsis" style="font-weight: normal;">Edit</a></div>Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description">It can be rough transferring to a new school&mdash;even more so if you don&#039;t want to make any friends, like Nobuaki Kanazawa. But the reason for his antisocial behavior soon becomes clear when his class receives a text from someone called &quot;The King.&quot; Included are instructions for the &quot;King&#039;s Game,&quot; and all class members must participate. Those who refuse to play, quit halfway, or don&#039;t follow an order in the allotted time of 24 hours will receive a deadly punishment.<br />
<br />
Having played the game before and watched as those around him died, Nobuaki tries to warn his clueless classmates. Unfortunately, they only believe him after the King&#039;s Game claims its first casualties. Stuck in a horrific situation with no chance of escape, Nobuaki has a choice: put his own survival above those around him, or do what he couldn&#039;t before and save his classmates.<br />

    “This show is fucking awful.”<br />
-Me<br />
<br />
The rules of the King’s Game are as follows:<br />
1. All female characters must be appallingly sexualized, this is a MATURE show for ADULTS after all.<br />
2. Every death has to be over-the-top and ridiculous, people like comedy relief, right?<br />
3. Characters must never exercise common sense, how else would there be a conflict?<br />
4. The plot must be as nonsensical as possible. We can just tell people it’s a “mystery.”<br />
<br />
Ousama Game is revolting. <br />
It’s not bad in a, &quot;Wow this show has so much mindless violence,&quot; sort of way. <br />
It&#039;s more like &quot;Wow some perverted sicko was literally paid to animate their disgusting fetishes”.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265831">
        not only repulsed by Ousama game because of the sexualization. I&#039;m repulsed by it because of how confidently it uses the horror genre as an excuse to create appalling sexualization. <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
The story goes in circles; introducing a few characters that you have no reason to care about, killing them violently for very stupid reasons, then repeating the cycle in the next episode. <br />
<br />
A group of students of some random class receive text messages from a person who calls themselves “king” aka Ousama, they say the students are part of a game and if they don&#039;t obey the rules they are punished. Seems interesting enough, right? And it kind of is at first until you realize every episode has the same structure; a bunch of random students are introduced, they receive a nearly impossible order from the king via their phones, they obviously fail to survive it and die in a horrific way. At least the deaths are pretty absurd at first, not that they make any sense. So much blood, so little logic. There was even a character who gets punished by being burnt to death and she just stands around for a whole minute entirely engulfed in flames and out of all things that she can do, she chooses to strips down. Yep. She literally is being burnt alive and the writer thought that was the perfect time to sexualize her. Humanity is doomed and Ousama Game will be the catalyst for the apocalypse.<br />
<br />
The characters often make the same frustrating choices over and over thanks to the poorly told story, the main character Nobuaki tells the story of the first Ousama Game he was in while being in a new game in present day. We constantly see the characters make the same mistakes thanks to this broken form of storytelling. It’s obvious that studio Seven didn’t have enough material from the first manga so to compensate they adapted the sequel story as well, but in the end, layering them on top of each other caused both to be incredibly underdeveloped. There is no consideration put into the pacing of the story, events are just contrived into existence and we’re just supposed to believe it. The only thing that keeps the show semi-comprehensive is the formulaic story; there is a group of random students and per expectations of the death game genre they will all be killed until there’s a winner. At least Ousama Game has a formula making it not entirely incompetent, but that’s not to say it’s original. It more than likely grabbed these concepts from better anime to cobble together it’s story without caring how the final product would turn out. <br />
<br />
I like the story concept of everyday people trying to fight against a personified Deus Ex Machina antagonist, but this idea is used, abused, then thrown into a dumpster and lit on fire. The King is never explored as an antagonist, it&#039;s just an excuse for mindless violence. It throws so many ideas at the wall but nothing sticks; it takes the cell phone gimmick from Mirai Nikki, it takes the fear of the unknown from Another, and the abundance of gore from both, but it does nothing with them. For all the flaws those shows have, at least they know how to build up enough tension for gore to not be totally undeserved. Ousama Game just throws shit at you and screams at you in an attempt to be taken seriously. How ironic that the director of Mirai Nikki worked on the much better death game show this season, Juuni Taisen.<br />
<br />
The show is so obsessed with its own edginess that it’s almost laughable. We’re constantly reminded how evil humans are when put into a complex situation like the king’s game. For example, a character who has yet to be even been given a name might beat up another character by order of the king and say something stupid along the lines of “It’s kill or be killed!!” Sure you could argue a scene like that would establish the tone and put forth a theme, but when the characters are so unbelievable it’s impossible to seriously analyze the morally reprehensible decisions they make.<br />
<br />
Characters: 0/10<br />
Yep, 0%. <br />
The characters make the show ridiculous and impossible to take seriously. If they just didn’t exist the show would be 10 times better. Everything they do is stupid. They get themselves into terrible situations and endanger their lives and the lives of their classmates constantly, but as you start to realize there is no hope for any of their survival you will find that their stupidity makes the show a comedic. They yell at each other and get nothing done. Constantly they deny that the King&#039;s Game is real, even though many of their classmates have already been killed; they just remark &quot;it must be a coincidence!&quot; and I chuckle every time I see that line.<br />
<br />
The main character Nobuaki is an asshole. He’s built up to be some kind of hero; characters constantly talk about him like he’s a saint who’s helped them through the game, yet we only ever see him treat them like crap. He treats other characters, but mostly women, horribly. He smacks them, he lies to a blind girl after causing their blindness, he forces them to do degrading things, and yet after all of the awful things he does to them they still sing his praises. These glaring issues start to make sense once you look at the staff page for this show. You will see that the “Original Creator” is named Nobuaki Kanazawa. The same as the main character. Yeah... the creator of this shit-fire placed himself into Ousama Game because it is HIS fantasy. At least it explains why all of the characters lose all sense of logic to praise him, but it&#039;s still really fucking sad that someone like that exists.<br />
<br />
This isn’t just broken character writing, it is harmful to the viewers who will no doubt take it literally and believe that it’s ok to treat women as horribly as Nobuaki does. (Yes there are people whose minds are molded by what they watch on television. Believe me, I’ve met them.) <br />
<br />
The one character I could point out as the antagonist is Natsuko, even if the Ousama could be counted they never make an appearance if we&#039;re to assume they exist at all. What&#039;s so frustrating about her is that, she is very clearly insane, she kills, manipulates, and swaps into her psychotic persona on the drop of a hat, yet none of the students think to say “Oh, maybe we shouldn’t trust that crazy girl because she probably wants to kill us so she can ensure her victory!” Never is this issue resolved. Characters are constantly tricked throughout the show and it gets to a laughably predictable point. You know that the unsuspecting random student introduced just minutes ago with less than 2 lines of dialogue will be killed by the end of the episode without any development whatsoever, so why even care about them? It&#039;s clear that no one involved in Osama Game cared at all about creating characters, they just wanted to create big breasted anime ladies to sexualize, which isn’t surprising considering the studio that produced it mainly makes hentai.<br />
<br />
Art: 1/10<br />
Flat and ugly visuals plague the show all around. The only scenes that seem to have been made with serious effort are the sex scenes, which is unsurprising considering the studio that produced it makes primarily hentai. Misshapen character designs make the show even worse to look at because the majority of scenes are them standing around talking (or yelling). Backgrounds range from mostly the school, character&#039;s homes, hospitals sometimes, but none of them are even a little nice to look at. The art becomes incredibly bad in the later episodes. Characters look laughably off model constantly. Blood looks like thick globs of ketchup which only makes the show seem more like a comedy. All you people out there who watch crappy shows ironically will find something worth laughing at in this show’s visuals.<br />
<br />
Don’t expect the edginess to make up for the show&#039;s issues because the atmosphere is crap too. Horror anime like Another, Shiki, and Higurashi showed us that it’s possible to make a horror anime with a thick atmosphere to immerse the viewers. But on top of the terrible visuals, the idiotic characters, poor direction, and hilariously bad script make it impossible to get immersed in. <br />
<br />
Sound: 3/10<br />
The music and sound effects aren’t good, but sometimes they work to comedic effect. Sound effects like the ringing of the phones when the characters receive a message from the king are timed to be jump scares or spook the viewer, but they add significant humor to scenes due to very predictable outcomes. The soundtrack is very mediocre and it reminds me of the type of music from old campy horror flicks, I like that style but it doesn’t fit with the mature tone that they were aiming for. Extra camp is always a welcomed addition to a pile of crap like this. You can never have enough unintentional comedy when it comes to Ousama Game!<br />
<br />
As if the show didn’t have enough edge already, the OP is emo/metalcore. And it really is not the good type, just loud and obnoxious. You’d do well to skip over the OP (and the whole show tbh). <br />
The ED song &quot;Lost Paradise&quot; is pretty edgy too but it’s not harsh on the ears, it should have been used as the op in my opinion. It&#039;s no surprise the performer of the song Pile is mostly known for her work on the idol series Love Live because she&#039;s quite talented (talent that King&#039;s Game didn&#039;t deserve). There’s a dub too. God bless the writers at Funimation for taking on this heap of garbage because the translated script is hilariously bad. The voice acting is expectedly amateurish. It’s not much better than the sub.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get a little bit of enjoyment from Ousama Game. Not once did I feel close to being afraid while watching it, but I laughed many of times. Actually, there was one time I technically was afraid of the show. At the very end of episode 12, there is the most fear-inspiring line in the entire show. <br />
<br />
“To Be Continued”<br />
<br />
Imagining there might be a sequel to this dumpster fire chills me to my core. <br />
<br />
Ousama Game is only semi-watchable when it’s showing off a slew of ridiculous deaths with really poor art quality because at least you can laugh at it. If that doesn’t sound like something you could enjoy then you’ll likely get nothing out of the show. Even if you intend to watch it for the overdone violence you’ll probably be disappointed because by the final few episodes it becomes toned down and more execution styles are reused. It can’t even do mindless violence right... Keep in mind though, the show never fully embraces the absurdity of its plot so the comedy doesn’t reach its full potential.<br />
The repulsive sexualization also prevents the comedy from being consistent. Whenever I thought it might get funny I was bombarded with unsettling fanservice that made my skin crawl, defusing any potential comedy.<br />
<br />
It’s almost always obvious when a character is about to die because they get a last minute line to characterize them and (attempt to) make you feel sad for them. Needless to say, this cheap trick never worked. Not once. The deaths are never impactful in any way. <br />
<br />
Final Score: 1/10<br />
Ousama game is broken, it is missing features that are necessary to tell a story. There’s no pacing, the director cares more about shooting the female characters in risque ways than actually telling a story, the actual story makes no sense and falls apart as soon as you think about it. <br />
Frustrating doesn&#039;t even begin to describe how I felt about the characters. They are stupid and will always be stupid, so don&#039;t go into it expecting a horror. I recommend only watching it as a comedy (if you really must watch it). I hate Ousama Game. If I could obliterate it from existence I wouldn’t hesitate to do so. Nobuaki too, he&#039;s up there with the worst protagonists I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime.

    Survival anime are nothing new when looking back over the last few years. Shows such as Btooom!, Danganropa and Mirai Nikki are all based around a particular survival game and have all found moderate to massive popularity among anime fans. Even outside of anime, you just have to look at franchises like The Hunger Games and Maze Runner to see how successful the subgenre is. It’s clear that stories based around a group of characters, their impending doom and how they try to survive such are intriguing to a lot of people. But why is that? Personally, I believe these kinds of premises can present

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265820">
        a darker look at morality; show a darker side to ourselves through characters put in a severe set of circumstances that test one’s beliefs, values, friendships. It’s surprising how a simple concept can turn into a thrilling experience hard to match anywhere else. But this is where I have a problem with most survival anime; they begin with a simplistic setup and never get deeper. Things like character development and thematic exploration are barely touched on in these shows, with more time used for cheap thrills, cringe-worthy horror and overall mindless entertainment. This is an anime that manages to fail at even these aspects.<br />
<br />
King’s Game: The Animation is an anime adaptation of a series of “cell phone novels” and is the most recent example of an anime to present us with a survival game that pits everyone against one another until there is one left standing. Considering what I could take from the poorly-designed cover art to the production studio behind it: Seven, who also made a couple Slice of Life comedies I’ve barely heard of and a ton of hentai, I didn’t have much in the way of expectations that this show would be anything good, but I was hopeful that it would at least be a fun watch. That was a mistake. King’s Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa, the winner of the previous “King’s Game” as he transfers to a new school in an attempt to escape his terrible past. Unfortunately, the game follows him and now his new class are all subjected to the survival game that Nobuaki is all too familiar with. The basic rules of the game are: obey any order sent by the King within 24 hours, failure to do so will result in punishment/death and everyone involved must play to the end. Now, with all the basic information out of the way, here is how King’s Game: The Animation manages to turn a rather generic concept into one of the biggest fuckups of the entire year.<br />
<br />
The first major problem with this anime is how it introduces the game, more specifically the “orders” from the King that everyone must obey. The first order involves Nobuaki and classmate Natsuko Honda having to kiss, otherwise they’ll be “punished”. The first order is extremely childish considering this is supposed to be a game where people’s lives are on the line. Show like this need to have some high stakes and consequences to match how serious the game is, also adding suspense and excitement to what characters will do, even if they’re predictable. In the first episode, any sense of initial weight here is lost once you see how all of the orders feel like they were made by a 10-year-old. And if you thought ordering people to kiss was already a dumb move, prepare yourself, because most of the orders shown throughout the show are forcing students to have sex with each other. Let me ask, how is one supposed to take a death game seriously at all when a majority of it is about groping breasts and coerced sex? It’s absurd and should not be taken seriously. Other dumb orders include not sleeping before you have obeyed an instruction and not doing anything unnecessary for 24 hours. If you didn’t understand the last order, don’t worry, the entire game isn’t worth the time and even the minimal effort required to understand. This is clearly a case of a simple concept turned ridiculous due to how serious the show tries to take it. But what’s even more ridiculous is the characters involved in the game.<br />
<br />
King’s Game deals with a class of 32 students, not including characters from Nobuaki’s past and none of them are developed to where you are supposed to about them except for the protagonist, and even then he comes off so bland and uninteresting that I’m sure a lot of people watching won’t care about him or the show a couple weeks after finishing said show. In fact, it probably would’ve been better to have killed Nobuaki off midway so it wouldn’t have been so predictably boring. But I digress. Most of the characters are just expendable and are made as victims of the punishments in a poor attempt to justify the gravity of their predicament. Literally about a dozen characters with no prior screen time die on the first day because they were sleeping, and viewers are expected to care? You don’t create sympathy from your audience by killing off characters in such a way with their only key feature being that they exist! That’s one of the most obvious examples of lazy writing in anime. But the poor writing doesn’t stop there, since most of the characters that do get screen time are completely one-dimensional, have no interesting traits and can be easily replaced with any of the nameless character that got killed off first. It’s one thing to say in an anime like this you only know a little about 2-3 characters after the first episode, it’s a whole other issue when half-way through watching, you still only now about a couple of characters when over half of the class is already dead. Not good King’s Game, not good.<br />
<br />
But that’s not all, because it just so happens that basically every single character in the show is a retard to the point where even if these characters were developed at all, it would still be difficult to feel anything when these characters die because of their own stupidity. The most blatant example of how autistic they can get is when Natsuko is ordered to have sex with a guy, asks to have sex with Nobuaki first, and then when denied does a whole 180 personality-wise, grabbing the initial dude and tries to do the act in front of all her other classmates. They try to play it off saying she was always psychotic and only acted nice, but considering how she was nice to everyone around her and even showed interest in Nobuaki before the game, I see this . But this is just small example compared to the dozens of time where characters show their complete ignorance to what is even happening around them. These characters are still kids, but the idea that most of them are unable to think for themselves what other players are doing in a game of life or death is bewildering to say the least. It’s like they have selective memory loss where they all just forget what happened 2 minutes before when a character was acting like a lunatic. Even just thinking about how the show would work in our world brings forth a whole new set of questions that the show never ever acknowledges because it knows just how full of bullshit it really is. For example, if so many students in the same class have died in such a short amount of time, wouldn’t there be police involved? Wouldn’t any of the students try and tell someone who isn’t a part of the game about what’s happening? Oh wait, I forgot. This anime doesn’t bother showing characters that are not part of the game. The way that King’s Game avoids showing any sort of outside influence that would have an impact on the game is enough to tell me that this is nothing more that mindless entertainment at a very low standard.<br />
<br />
Another big issue with King’s Game is how it tells its story. The story overall is not difficult to tell but it tries to combine both the present game with flashbacks of the previous game Nobuaki was a part of before transferring and it ends up being detrimental to the show. The flashbacks shown usually take up most of the episode and makes it a lot more difficult for most present-day characters to get any proper focus or development before they are killed off. The characters in these flashbacks can also easily be confused with characters in the present due to how similar all of their designs are, making it harder to differentiate between the two timelines at times. The transitions between the two timelines does not help to distinguish when a time-jump has occurred. I understand that this anime is trying to adapt 2 different instalments to the franchise, but it ends up being so unnecessary as all that was needed to show was few scenes with Nobuaki and his former classmates rather than encompass more than 1 story in 12 episodes. The outcome of the past game is already given as Nobuaki says himself that he was the only survivor. And the saddest part, most of the characters in the flashback are more developed that characters in the current and try to find out what the King’s Game really is, when it really should be the other way around as the flashbacks stop at episode 7, leaving us to deal with shit characters play out this shit storyline for the rest of this shit anime.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the punishments and actual deaths in this anime, I am once again disappointed. Not only because of how cheap so many of these deaths feel, but of how these death are nearly always shameless gore fests, yet not so over-the-top that they end up being hilarious. King’s Game is actually very similar to Another, a 2012 horror anime that also featured a cast of school students and had most of them dying in some of the most exaggerated ways possible that it almost turned the show into a comedy. Seriously, watch a couple of the deaths in Another, on their own they are way better than the actual show. I wouldn’t be surprised if the deaths shown here in King’s Game were inspired by Another, but even then, King’s Game fails to do that right. It has around the same amount of death and bloodshed as Another, but was never amusing, and while part of that is due to stupid actions by the characters, the execution of these deaths are also just anticlimactic. I never thought I would ever say that seeing a character literally explode in a pile of blood was boring, but alas here we are. Well done King’s Game, you even fail at being an entertaining piece of garbage.<br />
<br />
Now all that’s been said so far should tell you how awful this show is, but here I give you the biggest problem I have with this anime: The King. From the start of the anime the one in charge of ordering and killing off students is shrouded in mystery along with his method of action. The way he comes across as this seemingly omniscient and omnipotent villain had unique powers over victims similar to Light Yagami and the Death Note. But I was more concerned with the why. Why would someone or something so powerful and dangerous being dicking around with a class of teenagers, telling them to fuck each other or die a woeful death? What do they wish to gain from this and why do they not aim for something greater? But then King’s Game makes the revelation of the force behind it all, it is perhaps the most idiotic reveal I have seen in an anime. Ever. Anyone else theorizing about what could be behind it all gets figuratively dick-slapped as it makes any work or effort into understanding what this power is and how the students can beat it absolutely worthless! I’m not going to reveal the origins of the King’s Game but trust me when I tell you that it is almost as disrespectful as getting blue-balled by your partner on Christmas Day (bitch). I mentioned before how all the orders felt like they were conceived by a 10-year-old, but after learning about who the King really is I wouldn’t be surprised if the original writer had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. <br />
<br />
The only part of King’s Game that I can really commend it on is the production values, but even that has its fair share of problems. I’m not much of a stickler on the animation of a show, but let’s be real: this show was made in 2017, and it looks like it could have been made over a decade ago. Aside from some backgrounds, there is nothing visually impressive about this show and feels lacklustre for the most part. You just need to see how they animate broken fingers to understand how dull and low budget this project was. But it does have its merits: effective facial expressions convey a lot of emotion and a dark colour palette suited the theme of the show, and I can say that the animation was tolerable. The same goes for the sound, with nothing memorable with regards to OSTs yet nothing godawful. I know a lot of people will praise the show’s opening as the best of the season, but I found it boring after a few episodes, with the main line “THIS IS THE END THIS IS THE END!!!!” becoming a meme of the show. And honestly Inuyashiki came out the same season with an OP very similar, but about a dozen times better. The voice acting was below par all across the board, with the English dub being even worse. But if I had to choose, I would still pick the dub, because at least that way I won’t have to think about the show as much, giving my head a well-deserved rest after pushing through this.<br />
<br />
And there you have it. That is King’s Game: The Animation; a disordered, pathetic abomination of an anime I plan to never lay eyes on again. We’re at the end of 2017 and yet shit like this is still being made, but this is nothing new. King’s Game is literally Mayoiga: The Lost Village – One Year Later, and if you’ve never heard of Mayoiga, just look at its mean score and that will tell you all one needs to know. They were both cringeworthy horror borefests that started off bad and only devolved into something so pathetic that even the biggest advocators of schlock entertainment would find masochistic. At this point, King’s Game is worse than just edgy; it cuts deep and it hurts, before leaving a permanent scar; something to always remind you of how foolish you were to try and handle the King’s Game. You weren’t raped physically, but mentally and emotionally are left desecrated and missing a part of your soul that you’ll never get back. This is the chance one takes when watching any intriguing seasonal anime. Was it worth it?

    2017 has been an underwhelming year for fanatics of horror and survival based anime. Taking a close look at the lineups, there were barely any at all and the only ones we’ve got were short series that were easily forgettable. Where does Ousama Game position itself on the board? Terrible doesn’t even begin to describe what this anime turned out to be. Ousama Game is a primal example of how desperately an anime tries to get viewers to appreciate. It’s a catastrophe that self-destructed from the very start that the meme of “so bad, it’s good” doesn’t even come to close to describe what it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265818">
        really is.<br />
<br />
I can talk for hours about what went wrong with Ousama Game (King’s Game) but to start, we have to understand what this anime is really about. On the surface, it’s a survival horror show based on the manga of the franchise. The synopsis is very straightforward and highlights the rules of the King’s Game. At the center of it, we have a young man named Nobuaki Kanazawa who gets involved in this death game scenario as his life changes forever. <br />
<br />
At first glance, this anime seems to have some potential. The idea of a death game can be mildly entertaining despite how predictable these type of shows turns out to be. However, Ousama Game turns into a cheap social experiment of horror gimmicks that tried way too hard to look cool. Forget, cool. This show is asinine on so many levels that by the time you watch the first few episodes, you will label it as an unintentional comedy. Despite the show portraying it as a serious story, it’s absurdly stupid in many ways. These are found through the examples of the characters’ decisions, poorly executed plot twists, and over the top exposition that becomes a chore to watch. At first glance, you’d think that exposition is important for a show like this. But overall, it degenerates into a cluster of boring info dump with cheap story selling. What does this show really want to accomplish? I had to ask myself many times throughout the show because every time I finish an episode, it makes me shake my head at how it fails to capitalize on anything.<br />
<br />
The character cast consists of students from Nobuaki’s class. Because this show has a lot of characters, don’t expect any of them to get memorable characterization. The main focus is how Nobuaki tries so desperately to save others but always comes up short that ends in sorrow. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to ever sympathize with character loss in this show because there’s just nothing to feel for them. They are dropped like jobbers in some wrestling drama not because it’s predictable but because they are too blend to appreciate. Once in a while, there are shows that has a breakout character emerge from the blues. Ousama Game has none of them and its entire character cast is terribly written. For main male protagonist Nobuaki, he is far too generic to be any sort of hero. On the opposite side, there’s Natsuko, a manipulate woman who cares about nothing but herself. The show portrays her as a psychopath that no one should trust and to be honest, there’s not a single thing to like about her. It’s as if the show itself is self-aware in making her the most hateful character. If that was its intention, then it got the point across with all the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
Now I will say one thing. Ousama Game’s creator and story seems to really try to bring out the best of what it can work with. It consists of 12 episodes and that’s no easy task. However, the anime is a laughter stock with the genres it tries to capitalize. First, there’s hardly any mystery. Sure, there’s the “King” and the game itself has some suspense. But at some point, do you really care? Most if not all the cast are going to die anyway so what’s there to get thrilled about? Then, there’s the horror. Does this show really feel scary? If we talk about the death scenes, then that would be unintentionally comical. I can’t fandom how many times I laughed at character deaths. These ranges from jumping out from windows, hands being broken to pieces by overusing a computer mouse, or even heads twisted 180 degrees because why not. Some scenes are also censored (maybe fixed in BDs) that makes shows like Terra Formars look like a masterpiece. The supernatural elements of this anime is also very poorly executed such as the numerous times when the deaths happen. And drama? Oh, I already mentioned Natsuko since she’s the guiltiest of this example. Still, the overall drama is so ill written that characters are locked in a conflict with no interest. Now that I think about it, this anime is really missing a comedy tag because of absurdly amusing it becomes as more and more the “plot” unravels.<br />
<br />
Studio Seven’s effort in animating this show really makes me want to question if they even tried at all. This is technically one of their few full length show they’ve produced and yet, it fails in a lot of ways. Character designs looks cheaply made like they are from some B-horror movie. While character expressions at times can deliver psychology, it ultimately falls apart due to its raw quality. The violence also comes off in the wrong way with how dumb it looks. Finally, the fan service is just unbearable. There are sometimes fan service in horror shows that can be a guilty pleasure to watch. However, Ousama’s Game is just a pure disgrace with terribly timed segments and censorship.<br />
<br />
To be honest, there’s only one aspect of this anime I enjoyed and it’s the music. “Feed the Fire” by coldrain is one of the noticeable theme songs from this year with its rock/metal hybrid style choreography. It’s a shame their talent is wasted for a show like this. On the other hand, character voices are very annoying to listen to after a while. Nobuaki’s desperate screaming when things go wrong is extremely unbearable. Natsuko’s manipulative voice clearly gives a vile intention to make us hate her more. Other cast members are pretty much all forgettable except when you hear them scream to their deaths.<br />
<br />
Trying to get to the finish line for this show was a challenge for me. It’s like I was thrown into bugged video game and trying to find a way out. Ousama Game is among one of the worst horror survival shows I’ve seen in recent years. The unintentional humor fails to deliver itself in every way and a slap to the face for anyone that expected something good out of this show. The character cast are like puppets of a poorly made performance. And the story? Just burn it with a fire. <br />
<br />
There’s an infamous meme that “anime was a mistake” in the community these days.  Just ask Ousama Game and you’ll see why.<br />

    The King’s Game Anime Review. Anime from the Rabbit Hole<br />
<br />
The King&#039;s Game is the worst anime I have ever seen.<br />
Am not kidding. The King&#039;s Game is the most terrible piece of shit I ever had sat through<br />
I honestly shocked at the anime director’s ability to blow all expectations of god-awful anime that are popping out from the rabbit hole.<br />
When I aware that was I say this is the worst anime I have seen that it comes with the expectations of this somehow being worse than the likes of Big Order, Handshakers, and Eromanga Sensei which before I saw this they were the worst animes I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265826">
        have ever seen.<br />
I had no interest in watching this show because I thought it’s one of those shitty novel adaptions that pop up in every anime season. The only reason why I ever decided to watch this show in the first place because a couple of my friends were watching it and they told it’s an another Mayoiga which was one of the best B movie type anime I have ever seen.  It may be a garbage series overall but least it had the so bad its good charm which is the only reason I gave that series a 2/10 only because it had good comedy. However, I cannot say the same thing for King&#039;s Game this show is one of the most insulting, embarrassing, unfunny, lazy and inept anime I had ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Am going to end my intro here because this fucking piece of horse shit does not deserve my intro since this show clearly don&#039;t even give a fuck about anything so why should I?<br />
<br />
Fuck my life...<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
The story of Kings Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa who transferred to a high school. Due to the events of the last King Game his now afraid of getting intimate with his new classmates. Very soon he starts to open up to his classmates during the sports festival class relay. However, this doesn’t last long as he and his classmates received an email from &quot;King and from there start to go down.<br />
Before I kick the show back it the anime rabbit hole. the King’s Game is.<br />
Ousama Game or King’s Game in English is a game where a class of 32 people takes part in the survival game. Each student will receive a message from phones about the King order that they have to follow or else they will be punished/killed. Why did I explain this because the King Game is the worst survival game I have seen in fiction. Not only it’s contrived as hell as well being poorly constricted but the game keeps adding new rules that were not told from the first episode of the anime.<br />
Besides the King’s Game itself being a broken mess this show writing is abysmal as well having some of the worst shock value I have seen in anime.<br />
<br />
It doesn’t help the fact that the show relays heavily on the fucking flashbacks. Flashbacks, in general, are fine as long they have a purpose but Kings Games really got carried away with this. This show likes to random flashback to the previous King’s Game as well dealing with the current King’s Game that is going on in this anime and because of that, the show’s pacing is fucking broken!!! This show has the worst pacing I have ever seen in anime. <br />
What’s makes the pacing worse is the narrative. One of the best examples of the show’s fucking horrendous narrative is in episode 5 where the entire episode was a flashback of the events of the last King Game and the episode never goes back to the current King’s Game that is currently happening. It would have been better if the show did this episode 1 would have been dedicated to showing off the new King’s Game was happening then have it where our main character Nobuaki actually tells his experience with the previous kings game to everyone in the class than you have the next 3 to 5 episodes showcase all the events of previous King&#039; Game. I know it will be a flashback but do you know what it makes more sense in the narrative than you could have the last several episodes being dedicated to the actual true story that we are dealing with which is the current kings game instead of every episode in the show where it goes from the flashback of the last King&#039;s Game as well showing a little bit of the actual episode itself that isn&#039;t a flashback. In short, the narrative of this show is a fucking mess.<br />
<br />
Now if you though the pacing and narrative of this show are broken the show decides to butcher serious sensitive topics such as rape/forced sex to the point where it becomes a joke because almost all of the order has something to do with Sex/Rape. <br />
I CANNOT FUCKING STAND IT WHEN ANIME INCLUDE SENSITIVE TOPIC SUCH SEX AND RAPE IN THEY NOVELS!!! I swear the director for this show must be a disgraceful human being who thinks rape and forced sex is normal. <br />
Overall this story is a complete travesty has no redeeming quality whatsoever. <br />
0/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
The characters in The King’s Game are just moving bodies with edgy and cringe-worthy personalities.  The characters have no character development in the slightest, and they are not even likable. Every single character except for 1 which I will get into a bit are idiots. <br />
Kanazawa Nobuaki is a horrendous mentally broken down protagonist. <br />
Natsuko is a shitty nice girl type of a character who has a psychopathic side to her <br />
Naoya is your cookie cutter best friend type character.<br />
Ria is the only character in this show that I can consider to be kinda decent. Unlike every other human being in this show, she’s the only character that has a decently told back-story that we can relate too.<br />
It such a shame that she gets killed off after a certain episode in the series.<br />
However, Ria alone cannot save this pathetic excuse of a character cast.<br />
<br />
The rest of the characters are all utter shit that you don’t ever care for because they all have a brain size of Homer Simpson and they are all dumber than rocks. They are not even worth mention in the slightest.<br />
In short, the characters in this show are a fucking failure in every way possible.<br />
1/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Visuals<br />
Before I tear apart the visuals am going to talk anime studio Seven. Before they did this show they have done shows such as I can’t understand what is my husband is saying and Hentai. <br />
Why did I bring this up? BECAUSE THE VISUALS ARE A FUCKING DISGRACE!!!<br />
Boring background designs, shitty characters designs mixed with pathetic animation, camera directing, still frames and lots of budget cuts that rival episode 4 of Tokyo Ghoul Root A.<br />
It’s like this show was originally meant to be a Hentai but some dumbass from studio Seven decided to censor most the sexual acts visually and decided to add a plot that is contrived as hell.<br />
Am just going to end the visuals selection here since this show clearly doesn&#039;t give fuck about anything. <br />
1/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack is dull and just plain bad.<br />
The opening of the show FEED THE FIRE&quot; by coldrain is a great song and its easily the best thing about the anime then again if the best thing about your anime is an anime opening that can be downloaded to your phone as an mp3 file you know fucked up.<br />
The ending theme is generic and it not even worth mentioning at all.<br />
As for sub and dub, they are both mediocre overall and they are not even worth mentioning at all. I honestly feel bad for the Seyiuus and English voice actors who had to follow this garbage script.<br />
2/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts. <br />
This anime represents everything that is wrong with anime.<br />
It’s an anime that is so bad that it actually piss off the viewer intelligence as well making the shittest animes like Big Order and Eromanga Sensei look decent in comparison. It also fails as B movie type anime because unlike Mayoiga the show not only tries to take itself too seriously and fails but it takes serious/sensitive topics such as sex and rape and butchers them to the point where it all those topics becomes a joke for a narrative. <br />
The story was utter shit, the pacing was horrendous, the characters are hot garbage, the visuals are bad and the soundtrack was bland and boring.<br />
This is the worst thing I have ever seen from this anime medium and I don’t think it will ever be topped. It’s such an insult in every way and makes me want to watch things like Eromanga Sensei and Big Order again. As much I despise those shows for its offensive content and horrific characters. I rather take that than watch this broken show again<br />
Is it worse than Skelter Heaven and Mars of Destruction? hell yeah because least those ovas were only 19 minutes long. This piece of contrived rabbit hole shit is 276 minutes long.<br />
Stay away from this garbage no matter how much curious you are because it will bring you nothing but misery.<br />
Final Score.  <br />
As much I want to this garbage a deserved 0/10 I can’t because MAL doesn’t have a 0/10 opinion. Until MAL has a 0/10 opinion I have sadly give this piece of shit that belongs in the rabbit hole a 1/10<br />
