Hikari has only one friend at school, who is also a social misfit, and he is mocked brutally by most of his classmates for being creepy and weird. One day, he ends up having to clean the school pool with Igarashi Iroha, who appears to be pretty much everything he hates in real-life girls. She skips school, has a blunt manner, doesn&#039;t have female friends, and seems the sort to be promiscuous. However, she is friendly to Hikari, and even stands up to the people who make fun of him. Hikari&#039;s bitterness and trust issues lead him to say pretty harsh things to Iroha, but she never dismisses him as creepy. After a while, it starts to look like Iroha may become his first real-life, 3D girlfriend! Will he be able to handle it? (Source: MangaHelpers)">

</div><h2><div class="floatRightHeader"><a href="/dbchanges.php?aid=36793&t=synopsis" style="font-weight: normal;">Edit</a></div>Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description">Tsutsui Hikari is an otaku, and he mostly avoids social life. Hikari has only one friend at school, who is also a social misfit, and he is mocked brutally by most of his classmates for being creepy and weird. One day, he ends up having to clean the school pool with Igarashi Iroha, who appears to be pretty much everything he hates in real-life girls. She skips school, has a blunt manner, doesn&#039;t have female friends, and seems the sort to be promiscuous. However, she is friendly to Hikari, and even stands up to the people who make fun of him. Hikari&#039;s bitterness and trust issues lead him to say pretty harsh things to Iroha, but she never dismisses him as creepy. After a while, it starts to look like Iroha may become his first real-life, 3D girlfriend! Will he be able to handle it?<br />

    Are you a socially awkward otaku who doesn’t understand why mean 3D ladies don’t want your very eligible d? Sick and tired of the Real Girls and 2D waifus are all you need in your laifu? Then oh boy, do I have the perfect anime for you because I sure as hell don’t want it. <br />
<br />
3D Kanojo: Real Girl is a painful experience. A lazily shat out romcom that uses cliches and plot contrivances as a crutch to hobble its way through twelve agonizing episodes. Proudly it presents insultingly stereotypical characters that are anything but three dimensional.  <br />
<br />
All you need to do is gaze

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281648">
        upon this glorious shitfest and it becomes abundantly clear what the show’s main issue is: it’s fucking hideous. The art is a disaster; backgrounds are a mess of fuzzy colors, there’s very little animation, and in an attempt to stay on model the characters hardly change their expressions. All the show has going for its visuals are the character designs, and even those are just the same faces mediocrely drawn and in worsening quality as the show progresses. <br />
<br />
The love interest, Iroha, has one expression for the majority of the show, pouty sad girl, the main character Tsutsui is more expressive which also means more frequently off model. From time to time you’ll see characters slide across the frame on motion tweens with no animation whatsoever, making it seem like they go to a school for ghosts. And that&#039;s the closest the show came to making me laugh. <br />
<br />
Stiff character animation is partly to blame for the lazy comedy, but also the directing is so slowly paced that even if the dialogue was good (which it isn’t) there wouldn’t be much to enjoy. Awkward doesn&#039;t even begin to describe how the dialogue feels, it&#039;s clumsy in a way that’s too unnatural to be believable and too poorly timed to hit with any impact. Sharing some of the blame is the monotonous elevator music that adds nothing but a headache to any scene it&#039;s present in. <br />
<br />
The moment the opening song starts playing I feel like I’m about to have a stroke, the level of cringiness in the visuals with the depressed singing voice. The singer sounds so downtrodden like he’s about to end his life, I instinctively zip straight over to the mute button so I don’t have to contemplate the void while watching 3D fucking Kanojo. The rest of the soundtrack gives me the sensation of my brain slowly swelling from the aneurysm the droning music gives me. Repetitive looping of the same song with only two piano keys during dramatic scenes, slowly putting more pressure on my skull until I relieve it by turning the volume off. Do you like the sound of printers on repeat? Well, check out the sick beats on these action scenes because these swooshes and boops will knock your socks off. This exceeds all bounds of low budgeting, it’s just plain and simply lazily made. <br />
<br />
3D Kanojo falls flat on its face as a comedy, but there’s still room for resonant drama (spoiler alert it’s a cringy disaster too). A story about two emotionally damaged people sorting through their feelings together is an alluring premise, and with a better writer, it could have been good. It’s not fundamentally flawed, it’s just terribly executed. The characterization relies heavily on cliches, and the character-driven story uses only contrivances to progress. Rarely does a development in the characters feel deserved; the story is divided by misunderstandings, a third party drives a rift in the lead pairing, then the conflict is resolved by the end of the chapter rinse and repeat. 3D Kanojo is barely competent because it relies heavily on this formulaic cheap method of telling its story. Even so, a character-driven story is only as good as it&#039;s characters allow it, but they&#039;re trash too.   <br />
<br />
Tsutsui begins the show as the standard archetypal boy who hates real girls because people look down on him for liking anime… That’s not much of a motivation, but the series had room to flesh him out more. And nothing came from it; he remains a mostly oblivious idiot for the entire series. His only ‘character development’ comes from cheap contrivances that lead him into trouble with his girlfriend then eventually the issues resolve themselves. Instead of subverting the mountain of stereotypes it chooses the cheapest route and gratifies his misogyny by making all of the girls comically cruel to Tsutsui, with the supporting character Ishino to represent the mob of angry cardboard cutouts. Her only excuse for hanging around Tsutsui and his girlfriend is that she’s his childhood friend, yet it doesn’t seem like she has a good reason to be there at all.<br />
<br />
Ishino constantly verbally and physically abuses Tsutsui to an absurd degree, and of course she repeatedly asks out the boy who accused Tsutsui of being a pedophile. But don’t worry guys he said he was sorry so now he’s allowed to be in their friend group and even go on camping trips with them all (yes this is actually the direction the plot takes). I’m not sure what I was missing here, but how can someone go from actively trying to ruin a person&#039;s life to being ol’ pals in the next goddamn episode? It’s a suitably moronic resolution for that tire fire of an arc, but let’s leave it at that because we have more shit to cover and I’d rather not open that can of worms. <br />
<br />
Later on in the series, a stereotypical nerdy girl appears to serve as another case of the trope Not Like Other Girls. And of course, she&#039;s not allowed to just be an archetype because whenever Tsutsui sees her he accidentally comes onto her, making her fall in love with him. Tsutsui’s obliviousness defies all logic, no human is this much of a bumbling moron. Sadly this is 3D Kanojo and there is no room for logic with all these cliches stuffed in. Of course there is a plotline dedicated to this misunderstanding and the rift it causes between Iroha and Tsutsui. Lazily written misunderstandings fuel most (if not all) of the drama in this series. You’ll always know how to easily resolve a situation episodes before the characters do, it&#039;s frustrating and quickly becomes painful to watch unironically.<br />
<br />
Before Tsutsui and Iroha started dating, he sees the Real Girl herself crying alone in public, then proceeds to creepily follow her as she runs errands. Eventually, a shop clerk accuses Iroha of stealing, then he takes it as his chance to take off his hood and emerge from the shadows to defend her. Oh, drool… what a hero, this actually impresses her. That’s what their relationship is built on, him being a creepy stalker and she is not like other girls for various shallow reasons. At this point (the first episode) the show has divided itself from reality, the main character is no longer relatable and all of the playing into stereotypes the show has done goes nowhere, there is no subversion. The author of Real Hurl genuinely believes that otaku are creeps and the key to a girls heart is stalking her until she like you back, it’s hilariously stupid and borderline gross.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has worked in retail can tell you if you ever accuse a customer of stealing you will lose your job. The whole scene is stupidly contrived to justify Tsutsui stalking Iroha moments ago. It’s all so she can say to him “wow you are actually a nice guy I should date stalkers more often!” This is exactly why 3D Kanojo doesn’t even work as least cute passive entertainment! It fails at being both a comedy and a drama and is not even enjoyable as passive entertainment.<br />
<br />
I have enjoyed plenty of cutesy shoujos regardless of trashy writing, Kiss Him Not Me was pretty funny despite the stupid fat joke it was predicated on. There is no part of Real Girl that I found remotely cute or appealing. The main relationship is so codependent yet there’s no actual commentary on codependency. Even though she is the title Real Girl, Iroha has literally no agency in the story. Despite being this tough girl archetype she has so little characterization of her own. She’s pulled around in the story, never allowed to guide its direction. And Tsutsui’s isn’t always the one to drag her around. They even throw in the lowest common denominator &quot;not blood-related&quot; brother to tear her and Tsutsui apart in the final misunderstanding fueled chapter. There was even some 100% necessary incestual rOmAnTic TeNsiON that I can barely recall because at this far into the series my mind was shutting itself down to protect my sanity. <br />
<br />
Other than the codependency, the main relationship is downright creepy, but the show seems content with calling it cute. I had expected at least some discussion about how the main character literally stalks, takes pictures of, and fantasizes about his girlfriend typically while she’s asleep in the same room as him on multiple occasions (the author’s fetish hmmm??). But oh no, he’s an otaku so that kind of cute behavior is normal right? <br />
<br />
NO! This kind of awful stereotype is so moronic that it’s actually offensive. I take back what I said earlier, otakus deserve better than being portrayed like this; watch something, anything else. 3D Kanojo is not just a bad show, it&#039;s bad for us. It’s very clear that the author of Real Girl had no idea what otakus are actually like, and she wrote the main character based on a demographic she does not know firsthand. He’s an otaku because we’re told he is, he likes some trashy mahou shoujo anime because we’re told it’s good and therefore he’s an otaku, he hates women because we’re told so, he’s a socially inept dimwit because characters have to explain his emotions constantly. <br />
<br />
Tsutsui is so barebones and carelessly written that constantly we’re stumbling into these unanswered questions like; why does he like her, what caused him to hate women, what does he even like about anime??<br />
<br />
Score Breakdown:<br />
[Story: 2/10] Contrived and idiotic beyond belief. <br />
[Character: 1/10] Cliched, archetypal, thoroughly unlikable. <br />
[Art: 2/10] A messy disaster, lacking animation. <br />
[Sound: 4/10] Repetitive and uninspired.  <br />
[Enjoyment: 1/10] Comparable to being lobotomized.<br />
<br />
[Final Score: 2/10]<br />
3D Kanojo is so mind-numbingly stupid it defies universal logic, I can feel my IQ rapidly decreasing even at this moment just for contemplating the hamfisted story. But not only is it intellectually insulting, it&#039;s downright offensive to anyone who dares to try and relate to these grotesquely portrayed stereotypical characters.<br />
<br />
To top it off, the final episode closes on a non-ending halfway into the incest arc with a sequel already in the works. I can hear the mangaka laughing at me all the way from Japan because I hoped I could damn this to the void forever. Well, 3D Kanojo can fucking take the last laugh because I sure as hell am not going to waste any more brain cells on this nightmare.

An unlikely romance between an Otaku and a popular but broken girl that awakens their heart to the feelings that they have been hiding from <br />
<br />
<br />
Based off a popular manga of the same name 3D Kanojo real girl better known as Real girl is a romantic comedy anime that gives us the opportunity to look at what will happen if a high school boy shunned by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281627">
        his fellow classmates for being an otaku was to encounter the beautiful but badly reputed troublemaker Iroha and end up receiving a most unexpected answer to a question that he asked merely as a joke. The first episode of the series made quite the impression on me because of its unique premise of paring an otaku with limited social skills with a popular and beautiful girl that would usually be out of his reach and was interesting enough that I kept it on my watch list and I&#039;m glad that I did. <br />
<br />
Taking place in a modern-day Japan the overall story of 3D Kanojo girl follows the life of Hikari Tsutsui a high school student that while kind-hearted and decent is shunned by his fellow classmates for being an otaku and his encounter with the beautiful but ill-reputed high school girl Iroha Igaraishi and the surprising romantic relationship that they both embark on thanks to a daring question and a most unexpected answer. As Hikari and Iroha embark on their most unexpected relationship both must learn to break out of the shells that they have hidden behind all their lives and learn that to find what true love is they must first learn to accept the strengths and flaws of both their personalities and overcome the barriers that isolation in society have created in their lives.  <br />
<br />
Hikari Tsutsui <br />
<br />
Hikari Tsutsui played by new voice actor Teppei Uenishi is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school student and an anime and game otaku Hikari is a quiet, cynical and blunt person by nature that while intelligent and responsible is someone that is shunned by his fellow classmates due to his interests. As a result of this, in the beginning, Hikari was an anti-social person that was overly negative and preferred to stay detached from interaction with his fellow classmates with is sole friendship within the class being with his fellow otaku Itou. As a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates, in the beginning, Hikari had a hatred of real-life girls and relationships with them and limited the interactions that he had with them preferring instead the animated ones that he sees in anime and manga. While a kind and considerate person by nature as a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates Hikari, in the beginning, was a low-key person and preferred to remain in the background where he can avoid any trouble that comes his way.  <br />
<br />
As the series goes on Hikari’s personality gradually starts to change as a result of not just meeting Iroha but also many people that he befriends along the way. Though shunning and viewing romantic relationships with real girls as being nothing but trouble as the series progresses this view of Hikari gradually changes. While nervous about romantic relationships but at the same time curious about them Hikari’s desire to understand them was let down by the fact that he had no experience with it and more importantly had trouble reading the atmosphere and understand a girl’s feelings. However, as Hikari interacts more with Iroha instead of retreating back to his world Hikari gradually becomes braver and more willing to bond with and befriend other people that would have been outside his circle of friends at the beginning showing his determination to change himself and match Iroha. In line with Hikari’s new found desire to bond with and befriend others is his new-found interest in knowing the affairs of others especially Iroha and his new friends and try to solve the problems that they are bothered with to the best of his ability. While still nervous to a degree and having trouble putting his thoughts into words Hikari gradually learns how to get on with real people and as their bonds deepen show them the care and kindness that had been hidden behind his walls. While often frustrated by his inability to read the mood and his lack of experience in love Hikari does not let that stop him and tries hard to not just improve his own personality but also learn more about what love is showing how much he values the relationship he has with Iroha and how much he wants to improve as a person so as to match her. As the series goes on and as Hikari’s relationship with Iroha and his friendships with his friends improve it can be seen that while happy that his life is improving Hikari is somewhat constrained with the fear that perhaps one day all of this can change and that one day he might lose everything that he has gained by meeting Iroha and his friends. But until that day comes Hikari will make the best of the situation. <br />

Iroha Igarashi <br />
<br />
Iroha Igarashi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yu Serizawa of Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A beautiful and popular high school girl that attends the same school as Hikari Iroha is a kind, quiet and polite person by nature that’s also responsible and dutiful. Unlike most girls though Iroha despite having many classmates that want to know her is someone that seemingly prefers the solitude of being alone and as a result, she like Hikari lacks many female friends her age. While a quiet person that tries to stay away from trouble it can be seen however that Iroha is someone that dislikes seeing people get bullied and indeed is someone that respects bravery and determination which is best shown in her first interactions with Hikari. At the beginning of the series, Iroha and Hikari had a very unexpected encounter with one another that would later have much impact on their lives. Unlike the rest of the students that Iroha had met until that point, Hikari was unlike anyone that she had ever met before. While socially awkward in their interactions and having interests in topics that are unknown to her Hikari’s bravery in confessing to her and his determination to stay out of trouble was something that really touched her. While finding Hikari’s interests to be unique Iroha unlike the rest of the student body did not look down on Hikari and instead treated him with due kindness something that puts her in good stead in Hikari’s eyes and contributed greatly to his development as a character. While respecting Hikari’s determination to stay out of trouble it can be seen that Iroha dislikes seeing Hikari and her friends be bullied and will try to find a way to hit back at the bullies to deal with them when she can. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on Iroha’s personality gradually starts to change as she slowly opens up to Hikari and her new-found friends. While a polite, reserved and quiet girl that seems sure of herself on the surface beneath this it can be seen that Iroha actually is a very fragile person at heart. While certainly having more experience than Hikari in matters of love Iroha due to her looks has had to deal with confessions to her on a daily basis which created not just a large amount of stress for her but also an ill-reputed reputation among her schoolmates. As a result, this created within her mind a very negative image of what a proper serious romantic relationship should be like as most people that confessed to her cannot express a reason for why they liked her beyond her looks and thus creating a belief that people only care about her looks and not anything else. As a result of this Iroha while positive and cheerful on the surface is someone that is noted to be very good at creating masks that she wears to hide her true feelings from others something that was necessary in her life until she met Hikari and made new friends. To Iroha while Hikari is unlike any other boy that she has met before they have many issues that they share that enable them to bond easily with one another. The most prominent of these is the isolation that both feel in school and the lack of trust that they have for their fellow classmates due to their past experiences. While both Iroha and Hikari found it very hard to trust each other at first due to Hikari’s kindness to others and Iroha’s struggles to reveal her true feelings as the series goes on and both learn about what true love is this feeling of distrust gradually vanishes as for the first time in her life Iroha is able to place her trust in someone other than herself. While the relationship between Iroha and Hikari may have started off randomly as they interact with each other and learn more about each other Iroha starts to see and understand the true problems in Hikari’s personality but rather ignoring them as most people would start to instead encourage him to be more confident and proactive showing not just her love for him but also in the faith that she has that like her Hikari would be able to overcome the barriers that he has built to protect himself from an unfriendly society. The character of Iroha I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her gradual awakening of her true self and of finding someone that will appreciate everything that she has and not just her looks being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Yu Serizawa really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Iroha.<br />

In terms of animation, I felt that both the school and the areas that the cast visited during the series were both well designed and animated. The character designs for the cast I felt were also well designed and I also liked the designs of the uniforms that the cast wore as they attended school. The character of Ezomichi which is an anime character from one of Hikari’s favourite shows I felt was interesting as his discussions with it matched well with his desire to find a common ground in society and I felt that her actions in the series which was larger than her role in the manga helped greatly in providing advice to Hikari for the many trials that he had to overcome in the series. In terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of conveying the various moods and feelings that the cast felt as their relationships with each other developed. In particular, I really liked the series opening and ending themes which for the series was Daiji na Koto by Quruli and Hide the Blue by Bish with the former being able to create a sense of calmness while the latter being able to convey a sense of anticipation for the next episode. In terms of voice acting for the series overall, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I felt that Teppei Uenishi, Yu Serizawa and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Hikari, Iroha, and Sumie did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. The supporting cast for the series while not featured in this review I felt also did a great job supporting the overall story with Minami Tsuda, Shouta Aoi, Takuma Terashima and Sayaka Kanda doing an excellent job at portraying the characters of Arisa Ishino, Yuto Ito, Mitsuya Takanashi and Ezomichi respectively. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
In overall 3D Kanojo girl was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths being its unique premise, strong story, excellent characters, excellent voice acting and its integration of various but related themes into the story. While the premise of having an average guy falling in love with one of the schools most popular girls is itself not unusual within the anime world I felt that the unique premise that the series introduced to the concept made it sound even more interesting than the base concept something that definitely caught my interest. Within Japan, the term Otaku is a derogatory term unique to Japan that is used to label people that have obsessive interests in aspects of Japanese popular culture such as anime and manga. The negative nature that this term conveys means that people often look down on otaku and view them with suspicion and often causing distances to form between them and the person in question. Having the main character as an otaku that falls in love with a girl I felt was an interesting premise exactly because the lack of knowledge on basic human to human interactions is something that’s unknown to most otaku and seeing Hikari not only try to confront this overwhelming wall that stands between him and Iroha but make it work was something that really resonated with me. <br />
<br />
The overall story for the series I felt was one of its main strong points with its focus naturally being the relationship between Hikari and Iroha after their first meeting. True to most otaku Hikari, in the beginning, was someone that adored the world of anime and manga and as a result, bore a distinct dislike of human girls and interactions with humans that don’t share his passion which combined with his lack of social skills made him an outcast within the class that he was part off. Until Hikari met Iroha his life had always been stable and revolved around anime and his passion for it and being able to share his passion with like-minded friends like Itou. But the fortunate encounter between Hikari and Iroha resulted in the birth of not just the unlikeliest of romantic relationships between them but also created within Hikari a desire to change his personality and for the first time in his life embrace the world that he had for so long been ignoring and as a result learn what it actually means to be a human being. While the relationship between Hikari and Iroha is anything but smooth sailing seeing them both work so hard to overcome the many challenges both physical and mental that laid in their path as they try to understand each other’s personalities was something that I thought the story handled really well. But understanding comes in many forms especially when related to love and being able to bond and connect with your other half on an emotional level is just as important a fact that I thought the story dealt with relatively well in showing the secret insecurities that both Iroha and Hikari confronted and eventually overcome as their relationship developed and blossomed. While the development of Iroha and Hikari via their relationship was, of course, the main focus of the story with it comes a secondary aspect that’s just as important as the main one which is how the rest of the school and their classmates and later friends view them. With few exceptions, most of their classmates viewed the couple with scorn not understanding why and how Iroha ended up as a couple with someone like Hikari. But as their relationship develops and Hikari and Iroha’s hearts start to gradually open as they overcome challenges this sense of hatred gradually starts to vanish as for the first time they can see that both are trying hard to overcome the many things that were holding them back. Watching the opinions and attitudes of the supporting cast of the series change as they bore witness to Hikari’s evolution as a character and seeing them gradually realise their error and become friends with him instead of hating him was something that I really enjoyed seeing because it meant that Hikari’s attempts to improve himself had succeeded. <br />
<br />
Overall 3D Kanojo girl was a series that I really enjoyed watching with its unique premise, story and character development being its best points. The gradual understanding between Iroha and Hikari of the fact that love is not just about physical attraction but also an emotional attachment to the person that you love was something that I really enjoyed seeing and makes you realise just how deep your love for someone can be. As a final score, I would say that 3D Kanojo girl deserves a final score of 10/10. <br />

    There were two-romcom anime that were airing from the spring 18 season. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. However compare to Takagi San which was more a tease feast instead of a romcom both 3D Kanojo Real Girl Kanojo and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu were actually romcom that uses the character, drama, comedy and narrative to the fullest. However only one of the two romcom anime from the spring 18 season was good and that was Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. What Wotaku love is hard for an okatu has over 3D Kanojo Real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281656">
        Girl is that one the characters were likable, two that show was well paced and three the romance was actually great and believable. As much I want to go into more detail of why Wotaku is a better romcom anime than 3D Girl Kanojo stay tune for my review for Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. In that review I will go into more detail of why I love, Wotaku love is hard for an okatu while I hate this 3D Girl Kanojo which speaking of 3D Girl Kanojo is no contest not only one of the worst anime of 2018 bit is also one of the worst romcoms I have ever seen period.<br />
<br />
So what went wrong with this show?<br />
Your soon gonna find out.<br />
Hello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of 3D Kanojo Real Girl and with that said let’s begin<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
The story follows a generic okatu high school student named Hikaru Tsutsui who is shunned by his classmates for his otaku behavior. One day he gets set to do pool cleaning duty for being late along with a beautiful but reputed troublemaker Iroha Higurashi who is also considered an outsider by other students. At first reluctant to even talk to Iroha, Hikari is able to overcome his insecurity and defend her from bullies. In yet another pool-cleaning task, they decide to start a relationship. The catch? Iroha is due to change schools at the end of the year.<br />
<br />
The story is awful.<br />
Am not kidding this is one of the worst romance stories I have ever seen period.<br />
For starters this show does a horrendous job at portraying the okatu culture. Unlike Wotaku love is hard for an okatu where the show portrays the okatu culture in a more realistic way that is grounded and believable this show this show literally took all of that and throw it out the window in favor being comical and unrealistic. For example in one episode Mitsuya sees Hikaru helping his sister then Mitsuya tells his sister to scream in order for the police to catch him as well branding Hikaru as a lolicon for days. Okay I understand if you don’t like the person as the well the hobby that he does but you didn’t really have to out of your way to humiliate him in public like that so he can be a easy target for the police.<br />
People don’t behave like this and that event alone really shows how bad the character interactions are which I get to talk about now.<br />
<br />
Episode 1 alone is the worst first episode I have ever seen a romcom. Instead of having the two main characters slowly learning about each other the show decides to start off with a very contrived pool scene where they both of them fall into the pool. After that the show decided to have an awkward conversation by having our female lead Iroha ask Tsutsui that he is a virgin and Tsutsui replies honestly. The whole conversation feels forced and unnatural as both characters talk at each other instead of allowed a character they sentence plus nothing from that conversation was remotely interesting and because of these reasons alone the show did a horrendous job at establishing theses characters. <br />
To add insult to injury all of this shit happened in the first episode where both of these characters met for the first time. I would have been okay with this if that happened in later episodes where at that point the two main characters started to understand but having that scene happened in very first of the series really shows how poorly directed and written this series is.<br />
<br />
The single worst thing about the show is that the show itself at times literally forgets that it was a romcom anime as it the show at times devolves into a shitty slice of life anime with a poor portyal of otaku culture which completely kills all the potenal romcom thanks to its stiff character interactions and relationships.<br />
<br />
Overall the story in 3D Kanojo Real Girl is awful.<br />
<br />
1/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
If you the story was bad enough guess what? The character are even worse.<br />
Tsutsui is just your boring and unlikable okatu freak who is hard to relate to thanks to his stiff character interactions.<br />
Iroha is just your typical easy going girl who jealous a lot. While I liked Iroha more than Tsutsui in terms of personality I still thought she was a pretty mediocre character at best.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast are just throwaway romcom characters that we all seen before as they only to exist to create drama and conflict to the narrative.<br />
Overall the characters were just plan terrible.<br />
<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Visuals.<br />
Like with the story and characters the visuals are shit.<br />
The character designs for 3D Kanojo Real Girl are very uninspired as they look like they were done in 1 hour without a second thought.<br />
The animation is below average it constaints of shotty camera angles, still frame and overall weak animation.<br />
<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
3D Kanojo has very forgettable soundtrack overall. The same can apply to the shows opening theme however the ending theme was kinda decent.<br />
The voice acting in the show is pretty decent overall and all the Seiyuus did a fair job on each role.<br />
Overall the soundtrack is pretty mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
<br />
This show is a dumpster of a romcom anime that deserves to be burned and forgotten. The story is badly written to the absolute core, the character are all unlikable idiots, mixed with a forgettable ost, weak production values and poor story directing. If you want to watch a good romcom anime from go watch Wotaku love is hard for an okatu instead of this train-wreck.<br />
<br />
Final Score 2/10

    **Disclaimer: This is a Rant**<br />
<br />
After the second episode of this anime I was expecting this anime to be better than that atrocious first episode. What I got in exchange was a shitty romcom with misleading topics and very infuriating characters... Can&#039;t believe that this is getting a second season when a lot of good shows out there are left without a sequel. So lets get into details. (There might be spoilers)<br />
<br />
The &quot;story&quot; centers around Tsutsui who is an Otaku who only has one friend (A very shitty friend I must say). well, at least that&#039;s what this anime tries to portray on him. He has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281709">
        not contact with any humans with the exception of his neko best friend, he spends his spare time watching a mahou shoujo anime and that&#039;s pretty much his situation. I don&#039;t know what this anime tried to portray, the life of a very bullied kid or a wannabe &quot;Otaku&quot;, because I&#039;m sure as hell that this isn&#039;t the life of an Otaku, but of a socially awkward person who happens to like a Mahou Shoujo anime, I can relate to Tsutsui&#039;s situation here and thats why I felt so insulted while watching this anime.<br />
<br />
One day Tsutsui meets the most inconsistent bitch in town and for some reason she falls for him (I barely remember what was the actual reason, what I can recall is that the first episode was a clusterfuck of events) and this is where the trainwreck begins. The rest of the anime is spent in misunderstandings and shitloads of melodrama of the lowest quality possible: Tsutsui &quot;Fucks up&quot;, Igarashi gets mad because why not, his &quot;friends&quot; scold him saying that he is a terrible boyfriend, Tsutsui has an existencial crisis, his Mahou shoujo Waifu conforts him and encourages him, Tsutsui Apologizes, Igarashi blushes and accepts apologize, repeat. This not only gets old, its infurating because the reasons Tsutsui &quot;fucks up&quot; aren&#039;t such a big deal to be even mad for. Oh!, and lets not forget the plot device that is never touched again: Igarashi supposedly needs to leave town after 6 months and only God knows why... Is Igarashi going to die? never mind that, because that&#039;s left unanswered. (although I suspect that&#039;s the case)<br />
<br />
Characters in this anime are atrocious, some of them acts as &quot;comic relief&quot; but dear God, this &quot;comic relief&quot; isn&#039;t even cringey, it&#039;s insulting and infuriating!, how I&#039;m supposed to laugh at a &quot;mother&quot; who makes fun of his son and also doesn&#039;t support him when he is a suspected child molester? She doesn&#039;t even seem to care about his son situation on high school. This is not funny, its sad and infuriating, Tsutsui doesn&#039;t even deserve to have such a terrible mother, neither he deserves such shitty friends that are only there at the good times, because whenever Tsutsui &quot;fucks up&quot; they shine for their disappearance, or even worse, they act cold against him and insult him, he doesn&#039;t even deserve to have such an inconsistent bitch as a girlfriend, I swear, Igarashi must have reached the top 10 worst anime girlfriends in anime history.<br />
<br />
The animation isn&#039;t that bad but not great either, there are a lot of terrible shots where characters has deformed faces, it also fails on portraying events. And the sound... Thanks God I&#039;m not going to hear their voices ever again.<br />
<br />
Now I don&#039;t know if this is based on a real story and I don&#039;t really care about that, but dear God, this is a terrible depiction of what love is and what friendship is, its also terrible at describing the life of an Otaku, whoever make this totally missed the point of it. Go watch something like &quot;Welcome to the NHK&quot; which is miles beyond what this anime tried to achieve.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2,5/10<br />
<br />
