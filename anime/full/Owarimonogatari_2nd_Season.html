<br />
Araragi, with the help of his girlfriend Hitagi Senjougahara, maneuvers through the webs of his past and the perplexities of the present in search of answers. However, fate once again delivers him to the eccentric transfer student Ougi Oshino, who brings forth an unexpected proposal that may unearth the very foundation to which he is anchored. As Araragi peels back the layers of mystery surrounding an apparition, he discovers a truth not meant to be revealed.<br />

    Owarimonogatari season 2 is the conclusion, final chapter, to the main storyline presented since Bakemonogatari in 2009. And to say that it was a long time coming would be an understatement. It has been nearly a decade since I fell in love with this anime. While it has had its ups and downs it never became intolerable. For anyone who kept watching this series for this long or joined the train, enjoy the finale. <br />
<br />
Mayoi Hell and Hitagi Rendevous are arcs with essential information that is needed to be build up before reaching the final boss. The final boss known as Ougi has been foreshadowed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255276">
        for some time now. Who is she? Where did she come from? We will have the answers to all our questions in this arc. All the pieces that have been lingering will finally connect. <br />
<br />
Mayoi Hell consists of Ararargi going to hell after being intentionally killed by Gaen. If you haven&#039;t watched Koyominonogatari by now you should go back because it is very necessary. As well as obviously watching the rest of the series that has aired beforehand. Visually it is an extremely fun episode and seeing Ararargi and Mayoi banter after all these years is great. We saw them send each other off in the Second Season in a touching moment and in the Final Season, we see the wonderful reunion. The music that accompanies the touching moment towards the end pulls at your heartstrings. Can you call it manipulative? Sure but it sure has hell worked well. The comedic timing can be abrasive and I say this in a positive way. It&#039;s an onslaught of comedy smacking in your face with animation shifting from cartoony back to on model. With sprinkles of deep dialogue, we get a traditional Monogatari script. The most important element of the arc is Ararargi showing his attitude towards life changing but his heart remains the same. He will always want to save people even if he went back and did things again. However, he still shows some regret in the approach he took and how he could have improved on it. Anyone who has been interested in Ararararararagi&#039;s character development will be satisfied seeing him converse with Mayoi. In the second half of the arc, we are met with a character that was first introduced in Tsukimonogatari. To not get spoilers they converse about why Ararargi had to die and come back to life. This arc truly benefitted from the TV Special format because they were a ton of different settings being presented as Mayoi and Ararargi take a journey to meet the man who will bring him back to life. The animation quality was astonishing far better than what we saw in Owarimonogatari season 1. <br />
<br />
Hitagi Rendevouz isn&#039;t just a filler date between our main cast and heroine. While Hitagi takes a large chunk of her self-proclaimed arc, Ougi Oshino interrupts to speak about the important implications that were presented in Mayoi Hell. Ougi&#039;s near threatening dialogue and the sound design gives me chills down my spine when hearing her speak to Ararargi. Without having any knowledge of the next arc, Ougi Dark, you feel anxiety throughout. But wait wait wait let&#039;s get back to the date between our main girl and main boy. Hitagi probably looks the most beautiful here than in any other series. While this is obviously a personal feeling I had to put it in the ethersphere. But being beautiful isn&#039;t just about the character design, shaft really kept up with the animation and kept her on model almost throughout. With the obvious exception of comedic animation shifts. The backgrounds are rich and full of life as Hitagi, with her new driving license, takes out Ararargi on a date. The date itself was very charming. The most befitting to a 6 months relationship. To the viewers, it has been 8 years. <br />
<br />
Ougi Oshino is Ougi Oshino <br />
<br />
What makes this arc very different than most arcs is that it is a bit mature, not as mature as Hanamonogatari was but close. We don&#039;t see much fan service and we see a lot of reflection of the past. Its a somber ending. I am glad we are at the conclusion. But do not fret there are more novels to be adapted which will be. While they might not hit as hard as these arcs in this season it will still be a joy to watch. <br />
<br />
Thank you for the best 8 years of my life Nisio and SHAFT.

This review does not contain spoilers. This review is not made by a blind fanatic or a hater who has nothing better to do, this review is made by a person who saw this series for more than 8 years of his life.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be honest and I&#039;ll go straight to the point. I will not speak with fanaticism in my words, I will write just the truth about these episodes, my truth, nothing more and nothing less. I have no sweet words to these episodes, so if you can&#039;t digest a different opinion

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255561">
        than yours I ask you to not continue reading my review.<br />
<br />
I want to clarify this before I start, I&#039;m a fan of this series since the day it was released in 2009 and the second season is in my top ten favorite anime of all the time, so you wonder why I did not like this part? and the answer is very simple, I do not like this part because it concentrates everything that is wrong with the last works of the Monogatari series by the acclaimed Japanese animation studio shaft and directed by Akiyuki Shinbou, oh wait a moment is not even him who directed these episodes, that makes so much sense and at the same time so little, Shinbou why do you disappear when the fans of the old times need you more than ever? oh, I see you&#039;re a captain who does not sink with the ship, intelligent move on your part, traidor. <br />
<br />
One of the clearest problems is the speed with which the story advances, being so fast does not create a sense of importance in the events that occur in the story, at one point we are with a scene that pretends to be emotional and full of stress and the next moment the protagonist is making jokes about the underwear of a minor and you can tell me that that always happened with the Monogatari series but this time it is in a more clumsy, notorious and completely out of place way. <br />
<br />
It is really depressing and insulting for a lifelong fan to see that the mistakes of the past have not been corrected and not only that, but that the problem has been aggravated in such a stupid way that you can not do anything more than pretend that you did not see anything. I was the best accomplice of this series and I did not give importance in the past but I got bored of the same grotesque joke again and again, which leads us to the following problem with these episodes, which is the repetition of the same old material, these episodes only repeats the same jokes and ideas that in previous seasons, these episodes did not innovate at all and you know what is worse than that? is that the people behind this work does not even try or care about the fact that they are just recycling the old stuff over and over again, they are hitting your head over and over again with the same old ideas and jokes until you say enough and I&#039;m a fan who got tired of this deal, it is no longer funny, it is not innovative anymore, it is not even artistically pleasing as it was before. It&#039;s just an endless number of memes that died a long time ago. They pretend to be funny when it&#039;s just a lot of trash that they&#039;re recycling to not create anything new. Why strive to create something new if the old is accepted as something with some value. <br />
<br />
These episodes suffer from not giving much explanation to some important events that occur in the life of the characters, how convenient is to not explain anything and just move forward as if this were a race but the production team can take the time to do the same joke again and again, so it is not a problem of time, they simply do not care in the desire of the fans, &quot;give us your money and go away&quot;. Also includes many characters that are only present for a brief and insignificant moment, this is an insult to the characters themselves and fans of these characters, an absolute disgrace. In other occasions the characters act as if they were a stereotype of some very obvious program and they make clear what are their intentions although the series wants to generate an atmosphere of mystery, but is not a mystery if you are telling me everything directly or at least is not a good mystery.<br />
<br />
These episodes are the clear sign that studio shaft loves to play safe and just want the easy money of the fans who are hungry for more material, for more empty dialogues and characters pretending to be talking about something deep when it&#039;s just about the panties of a little girl. The fans are many, they will eat whatever it is, they must create something that many will like, easy to eat and bring it to their tables as fast as possible and the result is a hamburger. this is a hamburger that instead of having interesting dialogues full of new ideas is full of the greed of the people who are in the production studio, instead of having witty and provocative comedy has jokes about the tits of a little girl and instead of taking the time to develop the characters and be careful with their emotions has recycled material fresh from the trash. <br />
<br />
I firmly refuse to accept this insult to my loyalty for this franchise, I refuse with all my love to accept this mistreatment of my patience and I refuse with all my passion to remain silent, these episodes were the worst I saw in the whole series and it&#039;s sad that everything has ended in this mediocre way. Each movement of the characters was predictable, each word was said in the past and every joke was repeated so many times that it is no longer funny. <br />
<br />
Sweet dreams my beautiful monogatari series, you are no longer what you once knew to be. I have admired you for over 8 years, I laughed with your first jokes and I identify with some of your characters but after more than 68 episodes, 3 movies, 2 ovas, you&#039;re not longer what you used to be.<br />
<br />
I do not need buzzword like say &quot;masterpiece&quot; every 4 words to describe my feelings, I just let the heart speak and this review was made with heart and passion so I hope you understand that I do not hate this series at all, I just wish everything was better... Every moment, every word, every plot change in the story did not live up to expectation and the name of these series.<br />
<br />
Rest in peace. <br />
<br />
From a real fan who was waiting for this moment for more than 8 years.

    Before the review this is my personal opinion: I am so glad that this series didn’t disappoint me at all and I had such a great time watching it . Monogatari will always be one of the best anime I saw and I genuinely love it with all  my heart starting with the great characters and ending with the lessons told from each series. <br />
<br />
This is the final puzzle piece from the Monogatari series. In this series every little detail from the other series that were left unexplained was revealed to its audience. Another worth praising writing style from the author who knows damn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255340">
        well how to leave intentionally plot holes who are gonna be filled later in his future works. This is why the flaws are what makes Monogatari a great piece from the storytelling medium.<br />
<br />
Once again Shaft managed to use the visuals in perfect harmony with the current action of the characters and dialogue lines to emphasis the message for its audience. As an example I will mention  the fantastic and beautiful association of each character from monogatari with a star constellation during Ougi’s explications .The dialogue is well used for the characterization and plot helping with the progression of the story.<br />
<br />
As we all know the minor characters from Monogatari are so well used for the plot and characterization of the main characters and in this series doesn’t disappoint us at all . Who taught that Tadatsuru a minor character from Tsukimonogatari would had such a impact across the story in Owari 2. Let’s not forget Oshino Meme disappearance after Bake which had a purpose after all and finally Gaen who is the shining star from Owari 2 using again her brilliant mind to solve a problem. Fantastic!<br />
<br />
Owari 2 also manages to give screen time to the two main characters from Bake Senjougahara and Araragi. It’s always a pleasure to see Senjougahara verbal abusing Araragi but caring for him deep down in her heart proving once again why her actions are unpredictable and her personality unique. What I am trying to say is that in this series we finally see the choices that those decided to take as a couple for their future after their long fight with their own problems.<br />
<br />
One of the main themes that needs to be mentioned is about change,  portrayed through the actions and choices Araragi goes through . As for each part from Owari 2 they each have a different plot and message  but they are all connected to the main story from Owari 2.Mayoi Hell is the preparation stage for Ougi Dark and Hitagi Rendevouz is the bridge that connects them . In Ougi Dark  everything comes together giving a conclusion to the Monogatari series and presenting how the actions and choices the characters made influenced their lives .<br />
<br />
Trust me you will not regret any moment by watching Owari 2 , you will experience  a lot of emotions through each arc and the conclusion will leave you in tears of joy and sadness.<br />
This series managed to give a conclusion to all of the other series from Monogatari and answer all the left questions. <br />

<br />
Owarimonogatari was ultimately the end of the first, and most likely the main story of the series. These last three arcs provided a good conclusion and I wouldn&#039;t be upset if that&#039;s the final Monogatari-related product adapted by SHAFT. Although I doubt it, since there are tens of side-stories, epilogues, prologues and everything in-between left to adapt. This, however, felt like a proper conclusion. Even if it wasn&#039;t what I wanted, I can&#039;t help but feel happy about the ending regardless. <br />
<br />
Monogatari, ever since I began watching it, always left me with an air of ambivalence. If you go venture forth to the past and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255380">
        dig through to find one of my earliest reviews on this website, one of Bakemonogatari, you&#039;d see exactly that. Me struggling endlessly with coming to terms with my feelings about the series. It left me feeling sleazy and gross, but compelled and intrigued. I initially described it as the guiltiest possible pleasure and while my opinions may have changed with my tastes, I think that outlines the overall complexity of emotions I felt towards the product. On one hand the presentation is outstanding and unique, hearkening back and taking from the French New Wave, but what its presenting is often perverse and over-indulgent. The main narrative is fractured and presented in a spectacularly interesting fashion with the unreliable narrator quirk, but is often sidelined for pandering sexuality. The characters are multi-faceted and endlessly dynamic, but aren&#039;t often presented as such. It is an enigma, truly. <br />
<br />
While my opinions have changed and my appreciation for this series continuously grows, due to the amount of inspiration it has given me as a creative, this idea of conflicting feelings still remains the same. Even throughout this end-story. I get a conclusion, and the conclusion is quite good with just about every story wrapping up in a feel-good bundle of catharsis. It is still something that I wasn&#039;t expecting nor really wanting from this show. I was expecting something darker, something more somber, something with pain and eventual sacrifice and I was expecting the specialists to play significantly bigger role in the story after their buildup through Owarimonogatari&#039;s first season as well as the awe-inspiring conclusion to Koyomimonogatari. <br />
<br />
Maybe my expectations weren&#039;t deserved and built completely upon my own desires for the series, but that feels redundant to say as that&#039;s pretty much defining expectations for anything. Owarimonogatari&#039;s second season and conclusion does have problems, however, it is packaged and delivered so well that they don&#039;t feel like problems as much as they feel like additions that I may disagree with. Maybe that&#039;s why i&#039;m so happy to accept this conclusion even if it harshly isn&#039;t what I wanted or expected, that&#039;s my mea culpa. <br />

[Presentation] <br />
<br />
Before we delve deep into the semi-spoiler conversation, I think it is safe to say that this series is the best presented television anime. While it may not be as beautifully animated as something from Kyoto Animation or as viciously energetic as a Trigger production, it is a SHAFT product through and through. Harsh yet understated, with pronounced colors and a focus on bringing the most from dialogue heavy scenes. <br />
<br />
The coloring in these episodes is as good as ever, with beautiful shot-composition mixed in with spectacular changes in art-style in the first arc of this series. The other two were equally beautiful, with harsh changes of color and space, presenting even the goofiest character moments as if it is high-art strung up in a gallery. <br />
<br />
The violent, stinging violins in the climactic soundtrack continuously impress. While most people may point to the admittedly catchy opening themes of this series as examples of its musical prowess, I can&#039;t help but point to what I find more impressive. The memorable backing tracks to the shows most climactic moments. From the badass theme at the end of Nisemonogatari, where specialist Kagenui flexes her muscles in a scene so brutally cathartic that it is one of my all-time favorite anime moments. To the plucking strings and winding synths of the shows most surprising scenes, when Gaen reveals her vampire-slaying sword and chops our protagonist into a thousand pieces. The music here is as wonderful as ever. <br />
<br />
Monogatari has never been the most animated series, and for good reason. Much like most TV-anime it is a rushed product on a deadline. However, SHAFT make even the most still scenes feel alive and vibrant with the setting and shot composition, and as always the direction here is astounding. <br />
<br />

[Story and Resolution] <br />
<br />
<br />
Presented in three arcs, the final moments with these characters and their eventual graduation feel spur-of-the-moment. The show, for the first time ever, feels as though it has a distinct narrative purpose. Since it has one goal, to end its main story, it never decides to linger on moments that are otherwise unimportant to the series narrative. Even the second episode, the extended date between Senjougahara and Araragi feels as though it plays a direct part in the climax, Araragi&#039;s waning adolescence, Ougi&#039;s mysterious plot, and the growth between these two from a relationship standpoint. <br />
<br />
However, before we delve into that, we have the first story. Between Araragi, Hachikuji, and the involved Tadatsuru, which delivers something visually astounding and narratively intriguing, yet creates a few worries that may find themselves wriggling into the shows core climax.  <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
[Mayoi Hell] <br />
<br />
Obvious spoilers. Hachikuji is back and she&#039;s in hell. Some pretty funny reasoning is provided for that. More importantly, SHAFT gets to flex its visual style to the fullest here, providing one of the most visually impressive arcs since the gorgeous Tsukimonogatari. As Araragi ventures through hell, and to a certain extent, his past, he discovers how to return and what the reasoning behind his murder was. An elaborate plan by Gaen to return his humanity. <br />
<br />
Good stuff. Even if Hachikuji&#039;s return wasn&#039;t all that interesting to me. Especially since we have already said our goodbyes to that character and coming back after a pretty good send-off feels as though i&#039;m holding in a sneeze. Unrewarding and kind of painful. I like Hachikuji, she&#039;s quirky and engaging with a pretty great catchphrase that gets probably the best payoff of any joke in the series. However, I couldn&#039;t help but feel disappointed in her return as an establishment of norms and the lack of consequences. It robbed the series of some weight. More on her later. <br />
<br />
They meet with Tadatsuru and in beloved Monogatari fashion we get a gloriously long exposition sequence full of fascinating insights by this really intriguing character, as well as a quick look at the network of specialists that Gaen has established as being the backbone for oddity-hunting. Tadatsuru&#039;s powers are great and paint a understandable picture of Ononoki&#039;s creation, even if we lack the insight of her &quot;big sister&quot;, Kagenui, more on her later. <br />
<br />
Araragi is sent off with Hachikuji captured in his legs and brings her into the real world. Initially I had even more of an objection to this, as it totally undermined her exit even further. If it is so easy to leave hell, what is even the point of it? However, that gets amended further on in the series. The introductory arc here really set the tone for the show. It was lean-mean, and without filler, which was great. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Hitagi Rendezvous] <br />
<br />
Before I even talk about the date, I want to express how deeply upsetting it was to see Kagenui&#039;s character and her potentially incredible importance to the series being brushed off. It undermined the entirety of her disappearance in Koyomimonogatari as well as never quite explaining how Ougi got anyone to leave. It felt like an underhanded and obnoxiously pandering way to just keep Ononoki around the harem, which honestly doesn&#039;t fucking matter to me. Ononoki is pretty much useless right now, she is literally a doll and since Kagenui isn&#039;t around, has virtually no power. She is there to provide a few sparring dialogue driven moments and her inclusion in this arc felt completely unnecessary as she virtually did nothing. <br />
<br />
If they kept Kagenui relevant to the story and didn&#039;t chuck her to the side for literally no convincing reason, Ononoki and Kagenui could&#039;ve been back to actually matter and provide some interesting insight to spar with Gaen&#039;s own bias arguments against Ougi. Yet nothing like that happened. She&#039;s gone, and the reasoning given was that she was practicing &quot;Martial arts&quot; at what was later revealed to be the North Pole. Why? Why would she be doing that? Isn&#039;t she an immortal oddity specialist? Isn&#039;t her goal and job to exterminate immortal oddities? Isn&#039;t Shinobu back in her full-form? Isn&#039;t that Ougi? Kagenui expressed no fear in fighting Shinobu with her powers back in Nise, so it makes no sense for her to leave now. Way to completely under-utilize a dynamic and potentially interesting character. What a farce. This was probably the most upsetting moment about this three-parter and probably the only reason I had to take a point off. <br />
<br />
Especially since the date between Araragi and Senjougahara was wonderful. I always felt as though their relationship was a bit tepid. They said they damn-near love each other yet Araragi runs around fucking with plenty of other girls. It really doesn&#039;t make any sense and makes the entire relationship feel phony, especially since Senjougahara got almost no screen-time recently. Her return is welcome. She is the most dynamic and fascinating of the harem-girls and definitely proved that here. Her character growth since the first arc in Bakemonogatari is palpable and honestly very endearing. Her various little idiosyncrasies really paint an engaging portrait of her character. <br />
<br />
The resolution to their date is endlessly lovable and actually helps create a more believable relationship between the two, even if I still object to Araragi&#039;s lascivious and scummy behavior otherwise. I really enjoyed this, and I didn&#039;t find that it meandered or lacked any meaning. It was well-placed in the middle of these other two, more serious arcs. <br />
<br />
What i&#039;d be remiss not to discuss is the dream sequence with Ougi, which is not only a spectacular insight on her character but also plays as a wonderful hint at who she really is. Everything from her saying being a riff on Gaen and Hanekawa to her knowledge of the star-systems being Araragi&#039;s own knowledge, the pieces of the puzzle were finally falling into place and this fractured narrative was finally become clear. At this point, in my eyes, it was clear with who Ougi was, even if I wasn&#039;t sure what role she exactly played. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Ougi Dark]<br />
<br />
To refer back to my initial thesis, this arc&#039;s progress and climax wasn&#039;t something I was expecting or wanting, but a great part about growing up is being able to look at something as a whole and really determining whether that is a bad thing. I think the more I look back on this arc the more I&#039;ll come to enjoy and appreciate that it did something that I wasn&#039;t expecting nor wanting, but still managed to be entertaining and pretty damn impressive, narratively. <br />
<br />
My fear that the specialists would ultimately play a small role in the climax was unfortunately confirmed, as Gaen dumped some exposition and moved on. This and Shinobu&#039;s ultimate uselessness in her hyper-powerful form needs to be accepted as a narrative loop rather than a flaw, in my opinion. Because of course Araragi will ultimately have to face this issue on his own. It is, after all, always been his issue and no one else&#039;s. The narrative here had me hurdling through various flaming hoops of acceptance while also trying to follow along to the somewhat complicated explanations for everything. Needless to say, it was a gripping experience none-the-less.<br />
<br />
What particularly impressed me apart from Ougi&#039;s true reveal was the use for Hachikuji who&#039;s inclusion I have previously expressed my distaste with. Gaen&#039;s proposed solution was actually quite clever and made sense within the grand scheme of the story and provided the best use of Hachikuji&#039;s signature &#039;I stuttered&quot; catchphrase. It was great. I went from disliking her inclusion to totally buying it, which speaks volumes to how well this entire aspect of the narrative was delivered. <br />
<br />
Onward to Ougi&#039;s true reveal. I say &quot;true&quot; because her being Araragi&#039;s oddity didn&#039;t come as much of a surprise, of course she was. Especially the opening to this final arc solidifying that. What was more interesting a reveal was her role as Araragi&#039;s oddity, manifesting as adolescence. This actually paints a unique picture of Araragi&#039;s character and growth throughout the series. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m no stranger to criticizing our boy Koyomi here, since I think he&#039;s kind of a scumbag, however, the portrait of his adolescence was poignant none-the-less. This somewhat esoteric conclusion helped me understand the rest of this series&#039; motivations as well as his character progression overall. What could&#039;ve been myopic ended up being quite engaging, even Araragi&#039;s rejection of his own change to saving Ougi, which I was initially against but over the course of the past few hours warmed up to. Because of course he&#039;d save her, he&#039;s Araragi. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[The Moral of the Story]<br />
<br />
<br />
And now for the epilogue, or rather, the punchline. What Monogatari does so well is provide an experience unlike anything else in anime. An industry and medium that indulges in pulpy entertainment has this series which indulges in the idea of indulging. Consuming everything that is inherently right or wrong with the industry and presenting it as if it is high-art. Taking ideas from the most influential, yet also the most cherry-picked movement in cinema, the French New Wave, and crafting a narrative that not only doesn&#039;t treat its audience like children, but goes out of its way to be esoteric and challenging. Very much in line with the New Wave, Monogatari has a kind of style and essence to it that separates it from anything else in the medium. Especially since at its core it has these sleazy elements to it. <br />
<br />
Relating back to the initial point of contention, my dissonance with this series manifesting as a love and appreciation for it. These last three arcs, ones which lack the fanservice that some of the other parts of the series indulge in, are some of the most solid parts of the series, up there with the flawless masterpiece which is Hitagi End, my favorite thing I&#039;ve ever seen from this televised medium. It proves to me that this show could&#039;ve been better without its over-indulgent obsession with childish sexuality and pandering which often took up big parts of other episodes in other arcs, however, is that really true? I undoubtedly didn&#039;t, and don&#039;t, enjoy those elements, yet they are inherent in Monogatari being Monogatari. Without them this wouldn&#039;t be Monogatari, and the lack of them in these final arcs proves to me how big of contrast there is, which helped elevate the stakes and create tension which otherwise wouldn&#039;t have been escalated if the entire series was devoid of these elements.<br />
<br />
I feel like I always wanted Monogatari to be more mature than it was, however, once again, maybe that was wishful thinking. Much like Araragi says as the final line in these arcs, he is himself, and this series is itself. And expecting it to be something different when it so well-established exactly what it is makes no sense, logistically. Because much like Araragi, Monogatari experienced an odd kind of growth as well, where the maturity may not have increased but a realization did happen. The self-awareness here is palpable and as with any product that has displayed a knack for multi-faceted storytelling, I don&#039;t think it is out-of-line to analyze this series so extensively. <br />
<br />
During Ougi Dark, there is a scene where the characters dissect Ougi&#039;s formation as a cake. Each character representing a slice. Which honestly feels like this show being self-aware about its own indulgence, both having the cake and eating it to, which is an element I&#039;ve been bringing up in reviews since their conception. The cake here being Araragi&#039;s division and eventual realization of purpose, while also doubling as context for this shows harem elements. Which I wouldn&#039;t say is as much of an excuse as it is a justification, and a good one at that. <br />
<br />
Its harem elements were never the strongest parts of the series, and being myself I&#039;d go so far as to say they were the weakest parts. However, they, in the end, felt necessary to this show having the conclusion it did. For me, the strongest parts were always the main narrative and the specialists, who were characters that were infinitely more fascinating than the main group and harbored more interesting traits and purposes, but as I&#039;ve already said, it wasn&#039;t their story and I shouldn&#039;t have been expecting them to play a huge role here. My own, negative idiosyncrasy. <br />
<br />
In the end, this series which still confuses me emotionally provided an exceptional conclusion to its first and most likely main story, as it wrapped up its final arcs in an acceptable and thoroughly understandable way. At its most basic, the story of adolescence and accepting that adolescence permeates through the entirety of this series. Because if we were to fully strip it down, the punchline is that there is no need to let go of that. Much like Araragi isn&#039;t willing to let go of his own, even while saying that his adolescence has left him he acknowledges that he isn&#039;t fully an adult to Hanekawa. And I don&#039;t think that is really the point of this experience. It isn&#039;t much of a coming of age story. At the climax, he doesn&#039;t let go of the oddity manifesting as his own adolescence and that&#039;s the final realization. But I don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
But who knows, really? A series like this is so esoteric that even its most well-defined moments can be read into as something else and that&#039;s exactly what I appreciate about it. It proves itself worthy of being analyzed, as any great piece of art should. As I said in my very first venture into Monogatari, I only know what I know.
