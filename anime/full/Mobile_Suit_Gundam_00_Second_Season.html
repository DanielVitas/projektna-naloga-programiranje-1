In order to prevent such an event from recurring, an independent military organization called the Autonomous Peace-Keeping Force, or A-Laws, has been formed in order to keep the ESF Army and other powerful organizations in check. Charged with the duties of eliminating terrorists and resistance groups as well as unifying the nations of the world for the benefit of all mankind, A-Laws seem to be the best solution to the people of the world. Unknown to the public, the A-Laws quickly began to abuse their power. Peoples all over the world and in space soon find themselves stripped of freedoms and forced to live under the A-Laws enforced doctrines all in the name of “unity” and “peace”. Aware of A-Laws misuse of power, Celestial Being reemerges with the intent of stopping the A-Laws and correcting their past mistakes. What is unknown to these two groups is that a third organization, the Innovators, lurks in the shadows, manipulating events to reshape humanity into their own image.">

</div><h2><div class="floatRightHeader"><a href="/dbchanges.php?aid=3927&t=synopsis" style="font-weight: normal;">Edit</a></div>Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description"><i>Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Second Season</i> begins four years after the United Nations Forces were finally able to claim victory against Celestial Being. In order to prevent such an event from recurring, an independent military organization called the Autonomous Peace-Keeping Force, or A-Laws, has been formed in order to keep the ESF Army and other powerful organizations in check. Charged with the duties of eliminating terrorists and resistance groups as well as unifying the nations of the world for the benefit of all mankind, A-Laws seem to be the best solution to the people of the world.<br />
<br />
Unknown to the public, the A-Laws quickly began to abuse their power. Peoples all over the world and in space soon find themselves stripped of freedoms and forced to live under the A-Laws enforced doctrines all in the name of &ldquo;unity&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace&rdquo;. Aware of A-Laws misuse of power, Celestial Being reemerges with the intent of stopping the A-Laws and correcting their past mistakes. What is unknown to these two groups is that a third organization, the Innovators, lurks in the shadows, manipulating events to reshape humanity into their own image.</span><h2 style="margin-top: 15px;"><div class="floatRightHeader"><a href="/dbchanges.php?aid=3927&t=background" style="font-weight: normal;">Edit</a></div>Background</h2>No background information has been added to this title.

    Now, I thoroughly enjoyed Gundam 00 Season 1. Great characters, great action, and best of all, a wonderful complex plot. Throw in a good dosage of how it relates the present day world and great voice acting, and you’ve got a recipe for one of the most popular series now.<br />

Now, Season 2 started out with a lot of potential. The main characters were reintroduced very well, preserving the characteristics they were known for and refining them, along with offering a slightly different side of their personality. Some characters did change for the worse, but this is necessary to create the strife needed for the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13995">
        to build. And it did build. A new faction came into play here, and some of the old characters on the antagonistic side in Season 1 are not happy with the new world order. New characters are introduced very well and immediately create a third side to the previous two-sided strife in Season 1. There are many characters that are struggling to find themselves in the new world order, so the series has a bit of a depressive feeling to it. Not even Lockon’s lighthearted comments helped much here.<br />
<br />
However, as well as the introductions to the new characters were, the development of many of these characters had something to be desired. It falls into the same trap that swallowed Code Geass R2, which is to let new characters languish in development. However, while R2 introduces too many characters and has to shift back and forth awkwardly between the factions, Gundam 00 introduces fewer new characters and makes the shifts amongst them much more fluidly, going for &quot;Let’s integrate all the factions into the episode&quot; rather than Geass R2’s &quot;focus here for one episode, focus there for another.&quot; 00 also focuses on the protagonists much better. The antagonists (that fat blonde guy), along with Bushido, along with the Innovators, could have used more development, but at least I got a better idea of their true personalities better than the Knights from Geass R2. If there was one glaring complaint about 00 S2’s characterization, it would come in the form of antagonistic development in the form of the true mastermind, Ribbons Almark. An antagonist is supposed to create a feeling of hatred in your heart, or you fall for the antagonist’s plot and cheer on the protagonists’ failure. But the main feeling I get from Ribbons is ambivalence. &quot;Your comrade just got killed.&quot; *no emotion* &quot;You just got betrayed.&quot; *no emotion* &quot;Your test subject just wrecked your newest Mobile Suit.&quot; *no emotion* &quot;Your plan to take over the world has caught a HUGE snare.&quot; *Whatever* All he does is sit on a MAGENTA couch and twiddle on his thumbs, no matter if his plans succeed or fail. For someone who’s the mastermind, he doesn’t like to get involved much, like he’s a puppetmaster with really long strings on his puppets. Problem is, he feels disconnected from the plot and action, and well, let’s just say that 00 S2’s biggest fault after this is plot management.<br />
<br />
Now, the first… 2/3 of the series was developed very well. We get to see the main characters discover a different side to themselves and we are able to supplement the change with what we know about the characters in season 1. But after that, the series starts to stumble. The audience is waiting for a return of aspects that distinguished the characters from season 1. In creating a different dimension for the characters, they gave up the platform built up for the characters in season 1. Like Hallelujah, whose reintroduction was too sudden.  Welcome, but not well done.  Thus, after about the 2/3 mark, the series starts to wander and lose its footing. The focus is on little plot elements that need time to develop, but the producers only had so many episodes of plot to work with. Thus, the big plot elements were placed on the back burner and left to overcook. The series has to rush to resolve these big issues, but didn’t get to do so until the last 3 episodes or so, so it was a miracle that episodes 23 and 24 didn’t feel too rushed. What would have been nice is if they started focusing on these big plot elements around… episode 20 or so? But it’s no big surprise that episode 25 felt like you were landing an airplane but hadn’t slowed down enough. You do stop, but all your passengers are thrown 2 rows forward in your attempt. The series was haphazardly wrapped up as a result.<br />
<br />
But don’t get me wrong: Gundam 00 S2 is still worth your time to watch if you enjoyed S1. There’s still a lot to like, such as the more complex story, matured characters, and many characters just finding their true selves during their personal struggles. I’m not sure if I just expected too much, though. It’s still a likable series, but it just tossed away its potential for becoming a masterpiece about 2/3 of the way in.

    The conclusion of the first season left a bad taste in my mouth. That taste stayed throughout the entire second season, but by the end of it, I&#039;d gotten so used to it that I didn&#039;t care anymore.<br />
<br />
(This review assumes familiarity with the first season of Gundam 00 and references several season one spoilers. Season two spoilers are hinted at but not explicitly stated.)<br />
<br />
STORY - Gundam 00 had a precarious premise from the very beginning. The &quot;war to end all wars&quot; story is one that seems to be visited often, but because it&#039;s such an idealistic goal, series pursuing it always stand on a shaky

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15842">
        foundation of logic and realism. As a result, it&#039;s a very difficult premise to execute well. One of biggest logical gaps for me is still the idea that Celestial Being&#039;s two hundred-year old technology can be superior to that of current-day armies, especially since Celestial Being itself seems to have a very poor understanding of the machines they&#039;re making use of. Instead, they are reliant on a supercomputer and the notes and secret power-ups passed down to them by a dead man. All of the questions I had from the first season surrounding the organization&#039;s conception and survival over the last two centuries remain unanswered for the most part, but the most frustrating thing was not knowing the ultimate purpose of CB until the series&#039; finale.<br />
<br />
It blows my mind that most of the characters didn&#039;t even seem to know exactly what the &quot;real&quot; purpose of their organization was. It&#039;s one thing to keep the audience in the dark, but seriously, even the characters didn&#039;t know? Yes, everyone fights for their own reasons, but if you&#039;re part of an organization, you should maybe know what they&#039;re up to. Just sayin&#039;. The antagonistic Innovators are introduced this season as the new puppeteers of the world, along with their half-puppets, the A-Laws. Presumably, they know what&#039;s going on, but since the point of view of the story follows the members of Celestial Being more than the Innovators, the story becomes very reactionary. CB is trying to do this to stop the Innovators from doing this. CB does this because the Innovators are going to do this. But why should the audience care if they ultimately have no idea what anyone&#039;s fighting for? The goals from the first season seem to have gone to the wayside somewhere along the way.<br />
<br />
The flimsy storyline also contributed to an entire season of awful pacing marred by way too many romantic subplots. Seriously, could there possibly have been more of them? It didn&#039;t take long for 00 to feel like one gigantic soap opera that just happens to take place in space with some kind of war going on in the background. In fact, I&#039;d venture to say that the romantic storylines and drama were the main focus and the war, morals, and fate of the universe thing was the secondary subplot. Who will get Setsuna in the end? Marina or Gundam? Can Lyle save Anew from her overused mind-control plot device? Will Tieria ever be able to win Veda back from Ribbons? Will Allelujah ever actually do anything important in this series or say a word other than &quot;Marie&quot;? Will Saji ever stop being spineless, and will Louise eventually accept him again or just go to Andrei instead? Can Billy forgive Sumeragi for using him? Can Shirin and Klaus both survive to the end of the series for their happily ever after? Will Mr. Bushido ever give up on Setsuna? Will Patrick ever win Kati&#039;s heart?? <br />
<br />
It. Is. Ridiculous. To be honest, most of the relationship drama (romantic or otherwise) in 00 had the potential to be interesting, but the fact that there was so much of it limited the relevance of each individual subplot and put a huge strain on the viewer&#039;s ability to care, especially with an unclear central plotline to tie everything together. The conclusion of the second season and the series as a whole is just as bad as, if not worse than, the first season&#039;s ending. It felt similarly rushed, extremely anticlimatic and unrealistic, and didn&#039;t resolve nearly as much as I would have wanted. Many of the characters feel stranded at the end of the series, though you do get a resolution for most of the relationship nonsense, further supporting the idea that the relationships were the core of the series and that everything else was secondary. As far as the politics go, it was definitely more of a forced ending than a conclusion. A conclusion implies that things are actually concluded. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER - With a few exceptions, most of the first season&#039;s gigantic ensemble cast returned for the second season&#039;s &quot;four years later.&quot; A new season really wasn&#039;t necessary just for a timeskip, but it was still really nice being able to see Setsuna age. He&#039;s the most interesting character in the entire series just because he matures so much as events unfold, and even as he doubts himself, his motivation, and purpose in the world, he never falls into the trap of the Jesus-kun Syndrome -- when a character becomes a preachy moralfag and refuses to kill people, often accomplishing this by disabling mobile suits in battle instead of destroying them. That isn&#039;t to say that having morals and a conscience makes for bad characters, but I find it refreshing when the morals and conscience can coincide with the resolve to fight and the knowledge that killing is sometimes necessary. Rather than instilling the pacifist streak in Setsuna, Sunrise made a good decision in having Marina around to balance things out. As irritating and useless as she was most of the time, I think she was necessary to round out the points of views in the series; that is to say, she was a good idea, just poorly executed.<br />
<br />
Lyle, the new Lockon, felt like a huge cop-out from the beginning. Sunrise actually succeeded in killing a character! ...But here&#039;s his identical twin to replace him. Great. It didn&#039;t help that they never utilized the &quot;twin&quot; or &quot;brothers&quot; aspect to the best of its potential, and Lyle&#039;s logic failed on so many levels. He did not want to be compared to his brother, but essentially agreed to take over his brother&#039;s previous identity when he joined Celestial Being by taking on his old codename, his Gundam, and his Haro. Lyle&#039;s romantic subplot with Anew was one of the ones that had the most potential, and there was a lot of good acting as far as Lyle&#039;s inner conflict and reactions went, but in the end, I don&#039;t think his character evolved as much as it could have, and static characters remain uninteresting.<br />
<br />
Allelujah was amazingly disappointing throughout the second season and pretty much drops off the map after episode seven. You wonder whether his role as a Gundam Meister actually makes him a &quot;main character&quot; or not since he dwindles to the point where he doesn&#039;t even have any speaking roles for several episodes at a time. Since Hallelujah supposedly &quot;died&quot; for one reason or another, there wasn&#039;t anything in the way of personal conflict. Instead, he spends the whole time chasing after Marie/Soma Peries. Unfortunately, Allelujah/Marie interactions are idealistic and boring while Allelujah/Soma interactions are repetitive and boring. Marie&#039;s struggle with Soma and Soma&#039;s struggle with belonging and revenge are interesting for many of the reasons the Allelujah/Hallelujah struggle was last season, but the character(s) could have stood well enough on their own without the obligatory romance/attention of Allelujah. Really, Allelujah probably brought them down by turning it into a cheesy would-be romance rather than the revenge/moral conflict it should have been.<br />
<br />
Rounding out the Meisters, Tieria changed a lot between the first and second season. It would have been nice to be able to actually see that progress rather than just accepting that development had happened, but it&#039;s still refreshing to see characters that actually grow and change, and Tieria does continue to mature. Throughout the second season Tieria struggles with the fact that he&#039;s an Innovator and his role in both Celestial Being&#039;s and the other Innovators&#039; goals. On the most basic level, it&#039;s probably the most interesting of the Meisters&#039; conflicts, usurping even Setsuna, but poor execution, lack of attention, and being constantly thrown back by a dozen other subplots kept it from really succeeding, especially at the end. <br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, there are probably two dozen other characters all with subplots of varying degrees of depth and relevance. Saji and Louise&#039;s is especially prominent, but the themes of their relationship cover very little that one of the others doesn&#039;t already, especially now that they&#039;re both directly involved in the fighting and are no longer bystanders. Neither of them are particularly strong or interesting characters, and I still think that 00 would have been better off without them. It would have probably saved us about ten episodes of drama. There are also still an assload of characters aside from those listed above that make appearances at random, but aren&#039;t actually relevant to anything anymore. Ali Al-Saachez will pop up again every seven or eight episodes. As will Nena Trinity, who really should have just died in the first season with her brothers. And as will Liu Mei Wang and Hong Long, who really do anything at all the entire season. All of the Innovators aside from Ribbons are pretty much interchangeable, and even Regene didn&#039;t seem to mean much in the end. <br />
<br />
ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - The animation in the second season remains slick, and the battles are all relatively fun to watch. I really missed the Gundam Exia&#039;s design, though the 0, 00, 0-Riser, and 00-Riser are all pretty interesting as well. I didn&#039;t think the Arios was much of an improvement over the Kyrios, though honestly, you don&#039;t see Allelujah in action enough this season for his suit to really leave an impression on you. The GN Archer, which actually had a neat design, could have also been featured a lot more. Seravee and Seraphim also had a nice concept, but like the others, was ever over-shadowed by the 00 and 00-Riser. And the Cherudim? As with the Dynames, the prominence of the gigantic rifle made the rest of the suit less important, but even visually, the Cherudim was less to look at than the Dynames.<br />
<br />
The updated character and costume designs did a lot of good, I think, and I&#039;m fond of Setsuna&#039;s older appearance. The only new characters that are introduced in the second season are the score of Innovators. They come in pairs with hilariously punny names like &quot;Revive Revival,&quot; &quot;Anew Returner,&quot; and &quot;Bring Stabity.&quot; They also come in a variety of colorful flavors! Way to make it easy to spot the plot devices hiding out in the army and in Celestial Being, guys. There had to have been a better way to illustrate the concept of a race superior to humans without making it ridiculously obvious, right? The ease at which it is to spot these characters also makes the montage at the end of the series open to a lot of debate, but I really just think Sunrise is trolling us at that point.<br />
<br />
MUSIC - The music is probably what I ended up enjoying the most in this entire series. I didn&#039;t much care for the second season&#039;s first opening and ending themes, but chalk that up to my general indifference to UVERworld and Chiaki Ishikawa. Neither are terrible songs or particularly annoying -- just not my thing, I suppose. The second opening and ending, on the other hand, are probably why I even bothered to sit through some of the later episodes since neither of the singles had released at the time. &quot;Namida no Mukou&quot; by stereophony actually took a while to warm up to me because I found the timing awkward in many parts, but I loved the vocalist&#039;s voice and the energy in the song is just fantastic. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I loved &quot;trust you&quot; by Yuna Ito pretty much immediately. I&#039;d only listened to a few of Ito&#039;s songs prior to that, but &quot;trust you&quot; just blew me away. The melody is beautiful and the steady tempo really carries it through. Furthermore, the accompanying animation was gorgeous and well-timed to fit with the music, and it left a wonderful contemplative feeling at the end of each episode -- more than most of the episodes deserved. It was also a great follow-up the animation for the second ending of the first season, &quot;Friends&quot; by Stephanie. There are a few episodes that end with a brief a capella version of &quot;trust you&quot; that I found really unnecessary and awkward, but the song itself is great.Oddly enough though, I like the TV Cut much better than the full single.<br />
<br />
Tommy heavenly6&#039;s &quot;Unlimited Sky&quot; is used as an insert song for some of the later episodes, which was also pretty awesome. I adore Tomoko Kawase&#039;s voice in general, but I always find her anime songs much more energetic and upbeat than her other work, and &quot;Unlimited Sky&quot; is no exception. It always made the battle scenes that much more exciting -- a very needed extra when you&#039;re having a hard time caring about the characters involved or the storyline at the time.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the instrumental soundtrack for 00 seemed markedly improved in the second season. The leitmotifs are a bit more prominent and the music in general seemed to compliment the mood and feeling of each scene a lot better. It was really refreshing to see/hear something actually improve between the seasons.<br />
<br />
VOICE ACTING - Average for the most part, though I suppose Shinichiro Miki gets special mention for some excellent acting involving a very emotional Lyle, and Noboru Sougetsu (Ribbons), for managing to not remind everyone of Amuro Ray, at least most of the time.<br />
<br />
The dub is still pretty awful. The best of the dub cast is Brad Swaile as Setsuna and maybe Alex Zahara as Lyle; both are pretty average. The rest of the cast either sound painfully uninspired or just... the same. Half of the female characters in this series sound the same in the dub. It&#039;s must be pretty bad when I&#039;m offended at how poorly done the voices are for even characters I don&#039;t care about (which, in 00, is most of them).<br />
<br />
OVERALL - When I reviewed the first season of Gundam 00, my main complaints included the fact that they had more details than structure, that they didn&#039;t bother to explain a lot of what I would consider to be important backstory, and that there were far, far too many characters, all of whom were trying too hard to be the focus. The lackluster ending to the first season didn&#039;t lead me to have a lot of expectations for the second season, but I&#039;m still rather disappointed that they managed to let all of their problems get worse rather than better. In the end, I only saw 00 through to the end for the sake of having seen it to the end, which is never a really good reason at all. Then again, maybe I only saw it through so I could eventually bitch about it here... which really isn&#039;t that great of a reason either.<br />

    If you saw Gundam 00 season 1 and you liked it, you probably wanna see season 2 as well.<br />
But Gundam 00 S2 is crappy as hell (aside from the good looks.. the production value was top notch).<br />
<br />
I have to admit that I liked Gundam 00 S1 (except for the ending).<br />
Gundam 00 S1 focused a lot on the plot/action and because of that, the character development got neglected.<br />
But that didn&#039;t matter, because even with the 1-dimensional characters, it was still an interesting and exciting mecha anime.<br />
<br />
However in Gundam 00 S2, &#039;they&#039; tried to &#039;spice up&#039; the character development a bit.<br />
They totally froze the storytelling and decided

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13581">
        to focus (a lot more) on the characters.<br />
But they failed miserably!!! The characters didn&#039;t come &#039;alive&#039; one bit!!!! <br />
The result = crap.<br />
<br />
Hell.. what annoyed me the most were the things that just didn&#039;t make sense.<br />
For example the &#039;couple&#039;: Louise and Saji.<br />
Saji discovers something (very) important about Louise&#039;s tragedy (spoiler?) and &#039;every&#039; viewer knows Louise should know about this.<br />
But for some reason whenever Saji meets Louise, he NEVER discloses this important information to Louise.<br />
<br />
What we get instead is a lot of shit dialogue like: &quot;Saji..&quot; &quot;Louise!&quot; &quot;Saji!!&quot; &quot;Louise!!&quot;<br />
The same with Setsuna.. awww .. I&#039;m not even going to start with his &quot;Orewah Gundammmuhhh&quot; dialogues/monologues...<br />
<br />
In short.. Gundam 00 S2.. was bad.. very bad.. compared to season 1..<br />
The story became predictable, the (romantic) character development was crap, some unimportant characters died, <br />
bad guys didn&#039;t actually die in season 1, you get spammed with loads of new characters, <br />
Ribbons &#039;bitch-slaps&#039; female characters and they &#039;endure&#039; it *cough*.. and so on...<br />
<br />
But anyways .. loads of you brainwashed *Gundam-lovers* will probably love this show anyways.. <br />
So... enjoy the sequel you guys.. :|<br />

    The Gundam franchise has been a part of my life now ever since I was re-introduced to the franchise thanks to Gundam Build Fighters and Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans. Throughout my journey from this franchise I had seen a lot of great from this franchise but at the same time a lot of bad from this franchise.<br />
Nevertheless, I still had a great time watching all of the Gundam shows from this franchise and I don‘t regret it one bit.<br />
The U.C Gundam shows are mostly great sure they had its weak moments like ZZ and Victory but out of all the Gundam timelines, the U.C timeline is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278459">
        the most polished of them all.<br />
Now the alternate universe overall are hit or mess depending on your tastes and some alternate universe Gundam shows were good others ranged from meh to pretty bad.  <br />
Out of all the alternate universe, Gundam shows Gundam 00 got the most praise from the franchise even surpassing Wing and Seed.<br />
 So with all that said does Gundam 00 deserve that praise and does it hold when compared to the other Gundam shows before and ever since?<br />
Hello, everyone, this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Gundam 00 seasons 1 and 2 and with that out of the way let’s get started.<br />
Story.<br />
The year is 2307 as the result of the depletion of fossil fuels humanity now had to search for a new source of power. The power was found in the form of solar-powered Dyson rings orbiting the earth and supported by three orbital elevators. Each orbital elevator was served by one of the three power blocks of the planet which consists of the Union, The Human Reform League and AEU (Advanced European Union). Despite having this near inexhaustible source of power it really only seemed to benefit the major powers and allies and because of these minor countries of the world plunging into poverty and constantly break out into warfare just for fuel and energy.<br />
This ongoing chaos led to the actual creation of a private organization called celestial being whose main goal to end wars and end humanity. To accomplish this they created four powerful mobile suits each piloted by four people called Gundam meisters.<br />
The four misters being Setsuna F Seiei, Lockon Stratos, Allelujah Haptism and Tieria Erde. Together they carry out various missions to intervene acts of war throughout the war while the three powers try to eliminate them.<br />
The story for Gundam 00 is pretty good overall but it has problems which mainly appears on season 2.<br />
One of the mains things that I liked the series mainly season 1 is how different it was when compared to the other Gundam shows. It does away with the standard full-scale warfare that we see before from most Gundam shows from the past and instead, it tells a story that tackles some of the modern topics that the world is facing around that time such as religious and terrorism. I really adored where the first season went with this as it questions celestial beings motives. This is the stuff that I loved about Gundam. The first season made think about the issues that we have to face in everyday life. I was really invested in it.<br />
Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing for season 2 because it took most of the stuff that made season 1 great and throws it away in favor of a standard faction vs faction story that we see seen before. Not only that but the writing season 2 not that good when compared to season 1 where the writing was pretty strong for the most part.  Not to mention some of the topics and themes that were introduced in season 1 got preachy in season 2. It&#039;s not Wing or Seed Destiny level of preachiness but it was still preachy nonetheless. The last thing that I want to mention is the pacing. Unlike Seed and Seed Destiny where the pacing was broken beyond repair thanks to having a lot of flashback sequences, 00 pacing was a bit too fast at times especially in season 2 where it becomes a big problem for the narrative and character development.<br />
Overall the story for 00 is pretty alright for the most part. Season 1 by itself is pretty good that did a good job at tacking modern topics as well having good writing for the most part despite the small pacing issues in season 1. Season 2 however, is okay at best where it may had some great moments now and then it but was ultimately lackluster in the writing and pacing department not to mention the themes and topics got incredibly preachy in season 2.<br />
7/10<br />
Characters.<br />
The characters in Gundam are pretty enjoyable for the most part especially in season 1, however, feel like most of the characters in 00 don’t have much character development thanks to the fast pacing of 00 and it begins to the bite the show in the ass season 2.<br />
I will save the 00 boys for last but let’s talk about the other characters starting with Saji and Louise.<br />
I was honestly shocked at how much I liked them in season 1. At first, I thought these two were a waste of screen time however as the first season progresses I understood what the first season intended to do with them. They are normal people living normal lives that sadly get caught in a tragedy by the end of season 1 that changes them forever which was shown in season 2. Unfortunately, while I liked how Louise and Saji changed in season 2 I didn’t like them as much in season 1 especially Saji who for became a Shinji Ikari clone where he spends most of the show whining and doing dumb shit for no reason. It’s such as shame really because I liked Saji in season 1.<br />
Graham was a pretty cool character in season 1 and I really liked his determination of how he wants to beat a Gundam in battle. Unfortunately, he devolved into a shitty Char clone in season 2 and he didn’t really do anything apart trying to 1v1 with Sestuna and whine a lot.<br />
Ali al-Saachez is a pretty badass character in season 1 he was easily my second favorite charters in season 1. I loved how Sasschez was such a great rival/enemy to Setsuna and they conflict with the other was always a joy to watch. However unlike Graham who devolved into a mediocre character in season 2 he still remained a badass but now playing in second fiddle which is honestly sad.<br />
Feldt is a character that I really liked. In the beginning, she was an anti-social girl who barely says anything unless she has to. However, as the series progresses she starts to open up the Celestial Being crew as she starts feeling more comfortable<br />
Now if there was a character that was useless to the overall plot than it would be Marina who is by far one of the worst characters from the Gundam franchise. All she did in the series is preach about human understanding to Setsuna and writing a song that ultimately lead to nothing. As much I hate Relena from Gundam Wing least she redeemed herself in the movie Endless Waitz where she finally understands that she can’t achieve peace by preaching about pacifism and she far less annoying in that film. Say what you want about Saji and Louise but least they&#039;re felt like characters that a purpose in the narrative instead of being a useless plot device like Marina.<br />
The villains in 00 not counting Ali al Saachez were pretty underwhelming at best as they don’t have any motives other than taking over the world and humanity. You dropped that ball on that one Sunrise.<br />
Now that’s all the other characters done now let’s talk about the 00 boys.<br />
Tieria was really annoying at first as he liked to be a total dick to everyone in Celestial Being and he was glady to eliminate anyone who puts the plan in jeopardy. He eventually opens up over time and despite being the most feminist of the group I thought he was a pretty forgettable character that I didn’t like.<br />
The first Lockon being Neil Dylandy is my favorite character in the series. I loved his easy-going nature as well-being the most sociable out of the 00 boys<br />
I didn’t like the second Lockon Lyle Dylandy at first but the series went on I started to like him a bit thanks to him being a very skilled pilot as being kinda likable in the second half of season 2 however at times I feel he can be a total asspuller like Suzaku in Geass R2.<br />
Allelujah is a pretty interesting character as he has a split personally that appears every time he goes into battle. However, I feel the writers never really went anyway with it and it became almost irrelevant when you get to season 2 where he starts forming a love interest to Marie due to them being both experimental super soldiers of HRL in the past<br />
Finally, we have Setsuna who is one of the better Gundam protagonists from the franchise. Setsuna was once a child who slayed his parents to prove his loyalty to God but ultimately became disillusioned and grew to hate conflicts overall which lead him to join celestial being. In a nutshell, Setsuna is Heero Yuuji done right because not only much better-written character who compare to Heero who was a bland, contrived and stoic idiot from start to finish but Setsuna actually has character development. Throughout the series we see Setsuna trying to fix his own mistakes during his child soldier days. Also, Setsuna has an actual personality. Sure he starts off being as a stoic person after being traumatized during his child soldier days but as the series goes on he starts to express his feeling to people without reservation not to mention he starts to become more human instead of a stoic solider.<br />
Overall the characters in 00 were pretty enjoyable for what they were despite they shortcoming but having mostly underdeveloped characters thanks to the show fast pacing as well as many characters getting downgraded in season 2.  Besides that, I thought the characters were enjoyable<br />
6.5/10<br />
Visuals.<br />
Visually Gundam 00 is a massive step up when compared to the cosmic era of Gundam being Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny. The background scenery is amazing to look at that is filled with color that blends well with the tone of the series. The character designs were done by Risa Amada who goes by the pen name Yun Kōga and while haven’t check out her works but she has her own manga series called Loveless. Compared to Hisashi Hirai where most of the characters designs are the same from the Seed series Yun Koga did a good job at with the characters designs however I feel like some of the male characters look more feminine.<br />
As for the actual animation is honestly amazing. The fight choreography was great for the mechs, character movement is fluent and there was no stock footage used. Thank god because after watching Wing and Seed I got sick of seeing recycled footage all the damm time.<br />
If I had any complaints with the animation then it would be the overkill formula. Okay the overkill formula in 00 is not as bad when compared to Seed and Wing but it was still kind of an issue for me especially in season 2<br />
The mecha designs in 00 are pretty good overall and they were pretty original for the most part and like the mechs in Wing and Seed they all have their own gimmicks and strength but I feel they did a far better job at showcasing the mechs in 00 compare to Wing and Seed.<br />
9/10<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack for 00 is fantastic and it’s the war tone for the series very well. Easily one of the best soundtracks from the franchise.<br />
The season 1 openings and endings themes are pretty great overall and they are very memorable especially the second opening theme Ash Like Snow which is my all-time favorite Gundam opening theme as well-being my fourth favorite anime opening period.<br />
The season 2 openings and endings themes are not as great and memorable as the season 1 but they were pretty enjoyable for what they were.<br />
Now for sub vs dub.<br />
I only have seen bits of the sub for 00 but I remember the sub being pretty good.<br />
The dub for 00 is pretty as it featured a lot of well-known voice actors from the other Gundam shows in the past.<br />
Brad Swaile who previously voiced Amuro from Gundam 0079, Quatre from Gundam Wing and Dearka from Gundam Seed returned to voice the protagonist Setsuna and he honestly did a great job voicing Setsuna.<br />
Chanta Strandwho previously voiced Lacus and Meer from Gundam Seed + Destiny returned to voice Feldt and she once again did a solid job voicing Feldt.<br />
Scott McNeil who previously voiced Duo from Gundam Wing returns to voice Ali Al-Saachez who has the best performance in Gundam 00. He was fantastic at voicing Ali Al-Saachez.<br />
In short, both languages are great.<br />
9/10<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
After watching Gundam 00 as well buying the out of print DVDs from Beez Entertainment UK at my local Cex store how good was it. Well I think it’s a good Gundam series for the most part. Do I think it’s the best Gundam series ever made? Obviously not. I don’t think it holds up as well as other Gundam shows like G, X, Build Fighters Season 1 and Turn A but it feels it’s better than the likes of Wing, Build Fighters Try, Seed + Destiny and Victory. I feel like Sunrise did a good job with the series as it fixed a lot of problems that had with Wing and Seed. The first season alone is a great Gundam show that had a lot of interesting in it as well having fun and likable character. Not to mention the writing for the first season was pretty solid. It has some problems though. The pacing at was way too fast times especially in season 2 the characters aren’t the most developed bunch I seen in a Gundam show and season 2 as a whole is inferior in the writing department where it resorted of using a mediocre plot that we all seen before from Gundam shows from the past. Not to mention many of the characters got downgraded in season 2 and because of those reason along 00 season 2 is okay at best but when compared to season 1 is pretty disappointing. Despite its shortcomings, mainly in season 2 I still recommended Gundam 00 for people who want to start watching Gundam but doesn’t want to start too far back to the U.C Gundam shows.<br />
Season 1 score 8.5/10<br />
Season 2 score 6.5/10<br />
Overall Score 7.5/10<br />
