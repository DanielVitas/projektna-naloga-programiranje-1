Lux used to be called the strongest Drag-Knight, but now he&#039;s known as the &quot;undefeated weakest&quot; Drag-Knight because he will absolutely not attack in battle. After his duel with Lisesharte, Lux ends up attending the female-only academy that trains royals to be Drag-Knights. (Source: ANN)">

Lisesharte then challenges Lux to a Drag-Ride duel. Drag-Rides are ancient armored mechanical weapons that have been excavated from ruins all around the world. Lux used to be called the strongest Drag-Knight, but now he&#039;s known as the &quot;undefeated weakest&quot; Drag-Knight because he will absolutely not attack in battle. After his duel with Lisesharte, Lux ends up attending the female-only academy that trains royals to be Drag-Knights.<br />

    Originality is overrated.<br />
<br />
There, I said it. It&#039;s about time that somebody did so. Why? Because I&#039;m honestly tired of seeing reviews for this type of show that have a rating of 2 or 3 attached to them, simply because the series isn&#039;t „original“ and the author has seen something like it before. Now, how is that a legitimate point of complaint?<br />
Maybe it&#039;s because I have seen more anime than the average viewer, but I actually like getting what I know I&#039;ll like. Not only is „true originality“ hard to come by since most things have been done, but common business knowledge dictates that most innovations

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214717">
        are doomed to fail and the same could be said for anime productions. Not only from a commercial standpoint, but also from one that focuses on the quality of the product. I personally watch a lot of seasonal anime and, contrary to popular belief, there are a few series coming out every season that could be considered somewhat „original“. Problem is that these shows, as important as they sometimes are, are mostly crap and hard to sit through. Which probably explains why the average anime viewer very rarely watches them. I for one can appreciate a series that just gives me decent risk free entertainment. Case in point: Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;ll get to why I think that Bahamut succeeds as a show a little later on, but first I need to get this rant out of the way. No worries, there will be a proper review, just hang on a bit. If you want to go straight to the review just skip the next paragraph.<br />
There is no denying it, light novel based „(Special People) High School Battle Harem“ has become its own genre. Why do I know that? Because I have seen enough shows of this nature to make a Top 10 out of them with those featured on the list only being the ones that I absolutely love. There are probably another two or three dozen that I have seen and that wouldn&#039;t even make such a list despite me liking most of them. It&#039;s just a genre that I really like to indulge in, all its wonderful cliches and tropes included. I mean feeling attached to the defining characteristics is why we start liking a genre in the first place, isn&#039;t it?<br />
So, I don&#039;t really get it when I see people complaining about how what is essentially an average to fine entry into the genre is apparently the worst show ever. For one, if you have supposedly seen enough of these types of shows (which I highly doubt in a lot of cases) to call them „boring“ or „cliched“, you probably should have already figured out that they aren&#039;t for you. Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut is tagged „Action, Ecchi, Fantasy, Harem, Romance, School, Supernatural“ - don&#039;t tell me you didn&#039;t know what you were getting into. Everyone has their likes and dislikes. I am personally not a fan of romance or sports shows and their individual cliches. And don&#039;t tell me that those genres aren&#039;t just as cliche-ridden. Because they obviously are. You know what I do to solve this problem? I don&#039;t watch them. And I sure as hell don&#039;t hang around their anime pages and throw unqualified criticism around.<br />
Now, that&#039;s not to say that every critique of these sorts of shows tends to be unwarranted. You could definitely make a well-founded argument for Bahamut being a bad show, no doubt about it, but the problem is that I see the same illegitimate points being thrown around all the time and it&#039;s honestly making me sick.<br />
„The main character is a boring self insert!“, „All the girls just fall for the guy!“, „There are boobs and butt here!“, „I have seen that type of girl before!“ - every time I hear statements like this I just instinctively groan, because the people who make them clearly don&#039;t see the appeal of the genre, which is unfortunately not uncommon among Western viewers, especially those who are rather new to anime. And it&#039;s a very narrow-minded approach. Can those types of complaints be used to make an argument for a show being average due to following pre-established formulas? Of course, but, contrary to popular belief, average doesn&#039;t equal bad or even horrible. Things aren&#039;t either great or complete shit, most are bound to be average or somewhere around that level. Can you argue for the genre being a „lower form of entertainment“? Sure you can, but that is an entirely different topic and doesn&#039;t mean that every individual show shouldn&#039;t be looked at in the context of the genre. And these complaints are about on the same level as someone whining over there being explosions in an action movie or, to use a more anime-centric example, training in a Shounen. You don&#039;t voluntarily go to a burger joint and later complain that you can&#039;t order pasta there.<br />
„But Okocha, no matter the genre and their individual requirements, all shows still need to be judged using the same standards ...“ No, they don&#039;t. Judging every anime on the same identical scale and with the same identical criteria is a preposterously stupid thing to do. A series should be judged by how well it accomplishes fulfilling its intended purpose. Does it fail? Is it an average entry, meaning that it just about does it job, exactly the way you expect it to? Is it better at doing its job than most entries, making it above average? Does it completely meet the standards set by its genre? Or does it maybe even exceed them and what you expected to get from the series? <br />
Sure, a show like Bahamut probably won&#039;t have deep or intriguing characters, but that&#039;s alright, it doesn&#039;t need to. While such a thing can definitely add to this type of series, it is hardly essential. A character-driven mystery on the other hand falls apart if the aforementioned quality isn&#039;t present. Now, you might be asking: „Then what is important for a &#039;Special People High School Battle Harem&#039; to succeed?“ and while my answer to that is of course only subjective, here are some of the things I tend to judge battle harems on: The character designs, the girls&#039; personalities and how likeable/interesting they are, the quality of the action scenes, how „sexy“ it is, how much it made me laugh and finally the relationships between the characters, how well they work with each other. And taking all these things into consideration, I think that Lerche did a pretty decent, though not particularly impressive, job with Bahamut.<br />
<br />
So, let us finally get to the part that you (hopefully) came for: the review of the actual series. No explicit spoilers, so you can read this without having seen the series. Fair warning though: It will be a little lengthy and analytic. I&#039;ll put a summary of my thoughts at the bottom, so you can go straight there whenever you don&#039;t feel like reading anymore.<br />
<br />
First off, I deem it necessary to mention that Bahamut Chronicles is produced by Lerche, who are still a relatively new studio that has gotten a lot of attention recently due being involved with relatively high profile adaptations such as Danganronpa, Assassination Classroom or Monster Musume. While Lerche has struggled with production consistency before, most notably in the summer season of 2015, where they were in charge of making three shows at the same time, this is fortunately not a problem here. The show looks good, that much seems self-evident. It may not be getting any awards in regards to its visuals, but this is still a fine effort. The colours are vivid, the animations smooth and the use of CG models works rather well with the traditional animation (except for one notable exception, which still isn&#039;t on the level of some other stuff I have seen lately *cough* World Break *cough*), not creating too much of a contrast. Plus, there were some neat details here and there, during the last episode in particular, which looked absolutely stunning. As for the character models, I&#039;ll provide more of an in-depth analysis of them later on when I talk about the individual girls, but they are certainly pretty to look at, no questions asked. I have to say that the models are a little too slim for my personal taste and I&#039;m not a big fan of the show&#039;s sense of scale, but that is more of a minor nitpick and they should definitely be appealing to the average viewer, being diverse and detailed enough to pique interest and tell the characters apart. Which is saying something, because a lot of these types of shows suffer from the side characters being under-designed, which I can assure you isn&#039;t the case here. <br />
Overall you have to say that Lerche did a pretty damn good with the visual production of the show. Sure, it isn&#039;t amazing or anything like that, but it&#039;s very pretty to look at and has no major inconsistencies to sour the viewing experience. And hey, at least it&#039;s not Diomedea. Some of the direction is a little weird sometimes, like the need to constantly use split screens during action scenes (to supposedly up the intensity, I guess), but the scenes themselves more than make up for it, which is good, because they are essential for a show of this type to succeed. Fun fact: This has the same director as White Album 2. Now, isn&#039;t that just the weirdest little detail?<br />
<br />
Before we move on to the actual meat of the show, we also have to quickly go over the other important aspects of production, such as sound design, voice acting, OST and so on. Now, to segue into it from the topic of visual quality, both the ED and OP sequence are very well done. The OP is more or less your standard stuff. Catchy song? Check. Mishmash of Japanese and English lyrics? Check. Lots of foreshadowing and people hidden in shadows, because „oooh mystery“? Check. Shots of all the individual girls doing poses? Well, of course. I could go on, but you get the point. Still, it works very well. Don&#039;t change a working formula seems to be the motto of this review and it also applies here. The colourful art style and the catchy song make the OP an enjoyable experience that I never skipped past. The same applies for the ED, which mostly serves to show off some of the beautiful art and dress up our main heroines. Now, I can hardly complain about that, can I? Another notable thing about the ED is that it changes and adds characters depending on the arc the anime is currently dealing with. Even though the changes are small in nature, that kind of thing is something I always highly appreciate, because it makes watching the ED a more rewarding experience. Plus the song is just as good as you would expect it to be coming from nano.RIPE (Hanasuka Iroha, Non Non Biyori and more).<br />
Now that I talked about the OP and ED a good deal, I unfortunately have to say that I can&#039;t do the same for the rest of the OST. That isn&#039;t inherently a bad thing, the OST is fine as it is. It works, but that&#039;s about it. I don&#039;t remember a time when it was in any way distracting or unpleasant, but there are just no songs on it that I found to be worth remembering. Going back and listening to some of them only made that more apparent. It&#039;s not terrible, it&#039;s just very standard. Maybe you&#039;ll find a piece on the soundtrack that you find to be absolutely amazing, that is definitely a possibility, but for me it&#039;s more on an „eh, works“ level than anything else. And that&#039;s a little disappointing, considering that I normally really like the work of Akito Matsuda, especially what he has done with Kyoto Animation.<br />
As for sound design: I&#039;ll just say that it is really good, especially in comparison to some other shows that I&#039;ve had the questionable joy of watching recently and move quickly onward, because I know that only one in around 50 people actually cares about sound design. Then again, it needs to be mentioned that good sound design generally indicates that a studio is putting actual effort into a production and wants it to turn out good. Voice acting is probably a more interesting topic, but I can&#039;t really say too much about that. As Lux, our main character, we have Mutsumi Tamura (Jinta from Anohana, Jona from Jormungand), who seems to be stuck playing a male lead again, poor girl. Still, she does a good job with the character, adapting her voice to suit the mood, scene and, later in the series, gender (don&#039;t ask), so she remains a good choice for playing a male protagonist with a slight feminine site. She probably won&#039;t complain about it, considering the number of jobs she has gotten. Another performance that I find to be notable is that of Yukiyo Fujii, who I mostly know for playing either an innocent young girl or a young boy, so I was surprised to see her do so well with Krulcifer, who is more of a seductive and aggressive character. It worked really well. The rest of the cast do their job very well with well-known voice actresses such as Risa Taneda and Ari Ozawa putting in performances somewhere between standard and good. All in all, every member of the vocal cast manages to convey their characters individual personality rather well.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters: Let&#039;s move on to them. Before I talk about the individual girls and their story arcs, which I consider to be the most important part, I feel the need to quickly go over our protagonist, Lux Arcadia. The best way I could describe Lux is to say that he is the result of what would happen if Riki Naoe traded the interesting parts of his personality with Shidou Itsuka. Now, doesn&#039;t that sound appealing? I don&#039;t know about yours, but my panties are wet already. Again, as I mentioned beforehand, I don&#039;t think that the main character is a really important factor for this type of show. A really bad lead can easily ruin it, but having an average one is often enough to make the series itself succeed. The questions I ask myself to see whether or not the main character does a decent job are along the lines of the following:<br />
Is it easy to insert yourself into his role? That includes:<br />
- Is he relatable?<br />
- Is he strong enough to not be a wimp, but not so strong that he doesn&#039;t even struggle?<br />
- Does he posses qualities that the general viewer can find desirable (except for his fighting power)?<br />
How is his relationship with the harem members? That includes:<br />
- How is the romantic development? Why do they like him? Does he care about them?<br />
- How is the chemistry between them, both comedy- and romance-wise?<br />
There are other points, but those are some of the main ones that I look for and that popped into my head while writing this. More than it is always appreciated, but hardly needed and always comes in the form of a double-edged sword. Giving your character too much of a distinct personality, even something as simple as making him be open about his perversions like Arata Kasuga (Trinity Seven) can add a lot of spice to the conversations or even present some form of intrigue, but it can also have the negative effect of making the character less desirable and easy to insert yourself into, especially for Japanese viewers. You don&#039;t want to alienate your audience with this type of series, so it&#039;s always a gamble. Bahamut Chronicle doesn&#039;t take a lot of risk with its main character, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any point arguing about that. Sure, there is a part where (slight spoiler, but nothing of major importance) he has to cross-dress, but that too has been done multiple times before with his type of character. And apart from that it&#039;s mostly standard stuff. He is the only guy in school (which is still a genius concept for a harem, even if it has been overused to shit by this point) and the strongest person in said school, despite only just having joined and appearing rather weak on the surface. And of course he has a dark past that has come back to haunt him. As for his personality, he is caring, nice, a closet-pervert that is often put into suggestive situation against his will and as dense as osmium, but when the occasion arrives he will stand up to defend his, mostly female, friends. Pretty sure that I wrote exactly the same sentence in my Campione review. I should probably just bookmark this review so I can just copy and paste a lot this stuff when I write about Hundred next season. You, again, get the point. There is a reason why these types of protagonists have become the standard – they just work really well, especially for this genre. I could go on writing about how average Lux truly is, which really can&#039;t be debated, despite some of the fun moments that they give him, but at the end of the day I&#039;ll have to admit that he fulfills most of the requirements I have for his type of character and that I enjoyed most of the scenes he was in. A fine lead for a fine series in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Now, for the most important part, the individual girls:<br />
Before I talk about them one by one, let me say that I find Bahamut&#039;s harem to be weirdly „pleasant“, which is probably a good word to describe the entire show. Usually there&#039;s always at least one girl in the harem who I can&#039;t stand and find painfully annoying, but that thankfully isn&#039;t the case here. And the reason why seems pretty clear to me: Moderation.<br />
Take our main girl, Lisesharte Atismata (Lisha), for example. Lisha is about as main girlish as you can be. Well endowed, but not too much, royalty with a dark past, so plenty of trauma to explore there, a strong fighter that can fight alongside our protagonist but isn&#039;t so strong that she overshadows him, tsundere (because of course) and thus you, again, get the point. Shame that she doesn&#039;t also have red/pink hair, that&#039;s what I needed for my battle harem bingo card, though blonde is a nice choice as well and therefore appreciated. Now, a tsundere character is a nice thing in concept, but the problem is that a lot of shows tend to overplay the more or less bipolar nature of their girls, which gives us the often annoying back and forth mixed with seemingly random violence that a lot of people hate the archetype for. Thankfully, Bahamut doesn&#039;t have that, or at least not too much of it, which is why I mentioned moderation being one of its strengths. It never overstays its welcome, both in regards to story as well as characters. Lisha herself actually takes a back seat throughout most of the series. Her character changes drastically at the end of the first episode, somewhat of a trend lately, highlighting her dere side and then the spotlight is pretty much off her until about episode eleven. Even though her character is far from amazing, I still ended up liking her quite a bit, so I found her lack of screen time to be kind of a shame, but, then again, me liking her may also be due to not having her shoved in your face the entire time. A lot of main girls suffer from overexposure so having her role downplayed may have actually been a benefit for Lisha. So she does fine. And her design is definitely pleasant to look at. Well-proportioned is somewhere along the lines of what our protagonist said himself and I think we can let this stand as it fits quite well. I&#039;m really not a big fan of the school uniform, so I like that they gave her a badass white coat to wear over it, which fits her nicely. Another neat detail is that the author decided to make her a mechanic, so she actually has a reason to keep hanging around our protagonist. Well, besides trying to get into his pants that is.<br />
Next up we have Krulcifer Einfolk (Krul), who gets the arc after the introduction of the show (episode 3 – 5) and also the title of „best girl“. And yes, I am ready to fight you on that. While the main harem members are mostly „fine“, Krulcifer is the only one that I can honestly describe as great. Sure, you have probably seen her type of character before. She&#039;s kuudere, thus a little distant emotionally, but clearly aggressive when it comes to her dere side, which I personally appreciate seeing how I often tend to go cold (fittingly) on this type of girl once she officially joins the harem. They get lost in the shuffle thanks to tossing away their most interesting personality traits after the metaphorical ice is broken. This is not the case for Krul, who only became hotter (get it?) after she showed more of her dere side. Let&#039;s face it, she&#039;s not gonna win this thing, that is if there&#039;s ever going to be a winner (besides the author of course *makes ka-ching sound*), but you definitely can&#039;t criticize her for lack of effort. Not only does she have what I consider to be the most engaging arc in the show and clearly the best chemistry with the main lead, but her seductiveness makes her by far the most attractive girl in the show to me. And I&#039;m saying this as the kind of guy who usually tends to be into more „round“ girls, so it&#039;s quite an accomplishment for me to be admitting that.<br />
Speaking of girls whose designs I dig: Celistia Ralgris (Celes) everybody! Yeah, I wasn&#039;t expecting much of an ovation to be honest. Celes is definitely the most disappointing character Bahamut Chronicle has to offer. She is the only one that really gives me the feeling like she was just added to expand the harem and that is rarely ever a good thing. Her character fits into a couple of tropes, including the senpai, the strongest in the school and that of the independent woman who don&#039;t need no man, but is in reality a softy who just needs a hug. You&#039;d think that you could craft a pretty decent girl out of that, it has been done before after all, but this is unfortunately not really the case here. Maybe it&#039;s because her arc seems like it got cut short (only episodes six and seven without any prior build-up), but no matter the reason, I just can&#039;t find myself connecting with her. Celes wasn&#039;t very memorable, which is the most disappointing thing about her. And for supposedly being the strongest in the school, she actually ends up doing very little. Hell, normally this kind of character at least gets one scene where she gets to show off her strength by kicking some serious ass before being made irrelevant, but Celes? Nothing really. I honestly like her design and she looks pretty badass during the OP sequence, but all in all this is just a waste of your Risa Taneda, sorry that I have to be this harsh.<br />
Last on the list of main girls is Philphie Aingram (Phi) who combines a good deal of things into one, being the childhood friend as well as both the ditzy airhead and „the one with the huge boobs“ of the group (official title pending). And yeah, getting straight into her design, I do admit that I am a fan of rather large chests, but she might be a little too big for my taste. Rule of thumb (for me) is that if they&#039;re approximately as big as the head (one of them that is), then they&#039;re too big. And Phi&#039;s are definitely up there. But that&#039;s not to say that her design is horrible. I have seen a lot of characters in my day that were pretty much just breasts walking around (looking at you here, Arms) as that was the only part of the body that the artist paid any kind of attention to. That isn&#039;t so in Phi&#039;s case, who still has a pretty attractive figure and plenty of scenes where her breasts are not the center of attention from a visual point of view. They find ways to make her look attractive without focussing on the elephant sized udders in the room too much, which I consider praiseworthy. She also only gets two episodes of story dedicated to her (episodes eight and nine), but as opposed to Celes I think this actually works in her case. Why do I think so? One: she has been around for most of the series and her relationship with Lux has been well established by this point. And two: I think her arc would have ruined the mood the show was going for if it had gone on for too long. It was rather heavy in nature, especially in comparison to the rest of the show, so I like that they dealt with it in an effective manner instead of dragging it out for too long.<br />
<br />
On that topic, one of the main things I actually really like about this show is the way it handles its drama. Now, drama is something a lot of harems struggle with. You have to have some sort of conflict to make the viewer feel involved and interested, of course, otherwise you will just end up with a bunch of nothingness that doesn&#039;t leave a lasting impression (shout out to Infinite Stratos&#039; second season for that one), but it can&#039;t be dominant to the point that it takes away from the original purpose of the show, which is mostly that of rather mindless entertainment, at least not when it&#039;s not written very well, which tends to be the case. A lot of series in this genre fall victim to giving its (often badly written) drama too much time, to the point that it sucks any sort of enjoyment out of the show and just makes it boring. I often find myself begging a show to just get on with it, since it&#039;s not like we don&#039;t know how this is eventually going to play out. You&#039;re not doing quantum physics here, we have all seen this sort of story before and having to suffer through an overly long watered down version of it isn&#039;t fun for anybody. Bahamut Chronicle fortunately doesn&#039;t take this pitfall and deals with its drama in a decent way. It&#039;s not overplayed to the degree where it becomes painful. <br />
And that&#039;s probably the thing I enjoy most about UBC. It&#039;s constantly fun and entertaining and never gets annoying or boring due to overplaying certain aspects concerning story or characters, which is a complaint I often have with shows similar to it. There is nothing wrong with being superficial in nature, a lot of great entertainment is superficial, but don&#039;t try to simulate depth for the sake of it, that rarely ever works. Bahamut doesn&#039;t shine in regards to content, but rather when you look at how said content is delivered. It&#039;s a highly streamlined product that instead of trying to do a lot of new things focused on polishing up a successful formula to make it as enjoyable as possible. And I can respect that.<br />
<br />
Before we finish this up, I first need to talk about the supporting cast for a bit. Now, as I said before, the designs are what make the supporting cast memorable for me. Because I sure as hell can&#039;t remember their names. Can&#039;t we just go back to the good old Japanese names? Anyway, the „potential side harem“ is made up of the one with the weird speech pattern, the one that&#039;s kind of a pervert and the one -ehm- with -ehm- the blue hair? Yeah, I don&#039;t really have a name for her, but I remember her design and that&#039;s what counts. There&#039;s also the obligatory little sister (Just to put your mind at ease: There have been no hints towards a potential incest arc so far.), who actually gets more screen time than I expected her to and becomes a little important later in the story as the focus shifts more towards Lux and his family, a shift I personally didn&#039;t mind all that much, largely due to me finding her quite likeable. I admittedly attribute a lot of this to her being voiced by one of my favourite newer voice actresses coupled with a very pleasant design, but I definitely wouldn&#039;t mind if she got a proper arc at some point in the future. In addition to her, there&#039;s also another girl that could be considered of major importance: Yoruka Kirihime. MAL lists her as a main character, which I find strange considering that she doesn&#039;t enter the show until pretty late in the series and doesn&#039;t really get much focus because of how much other stuff is going on at the time, but I can&#039;t really avoid mentioning her. I think that it&#039;s a huge shame that she didn&#039;t really get the screen time to back up that main character billing, because I personally really liked what we saw of Yoruka, both design- and personality wise. She actually seems really interesting, which makes me wish that we could have just made her a member of the main harem instead of Celes. Yep, still bitter about that. Well, maybe we&#039;ll get a season two at some point in the future and thus more of her, you never know.<br />
Oh yeah, I completely forgot that I should probably also talk about the villains. Alright, short summary: They are lame. No point dancing around the obvious here, battle harems rarely ever have good antagonists and this is truly no exception to that rule. They are evil assholes who are evil and asshole-ish. In this type of show the role of the villain is usually used as a catalyst to promote character growth for our mains and that is exactly what Bahamut uses them for. They are not particularly enjoyable or interesting with one minor exception who I already talked about, so no use wasting anymore time, let&#039;s move on.<br />
<br />
And since we&#039;re already talking about one of the minor negative points of the show, I say we do some more of that. This review is a little too positive as it is, weirdly uncharacteristic for me to say the least, so I&#039;m going to get into some of the things I didn&#039;t like about Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut. First off, there is no denying that episode one is almost impressively bland. Tell someone to come up with a first episode summary that is representative of this genre and his answer will probably be pretty close to what Bahamut Chronicle offered us. I have said many times before that you don&#039;t have to bring anything new to the table as long as you make it enjoyable, but this was a little too dull, even for my taste. To expand on the analogy: it&#039;s a fine experience to go to your usual kind of restaurant and have what you like, but you should mix it up at least a little, especially if you go there on a daily basis. This honestly felt more like getting the exactly same thing for a first course that you had yesterday at a different place with no special seasoning added to distinguish it. The episode did serve its purpose, but it was still a little flat and could have definitely been done better, no questions asked. Still, there are more severe problems than that. One that personally irks me a lot, probably the biggest issue I have with the show, is the following: it just isn&#039;t very „sexy“. Now, what qualifies as „sexiness“ is of course completely subjective, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt, but I just found the series to be lacking in that department. Sure, there are the usual fanservicey things including pretty girls in very little clothing (or none at all) getting into rather suggestive situations, our main character having unlucky „accidents“, which just happen to make him look like he&#039;s one of hell of a horny pervert and the list goes on. But those kind of scenes are, one, surprisingly rare and, two, not very „hot“. None of them are really all that steamy. I&#039;m not 100% sure why this is the case, but I do have some possible explanations. The scenes are presented from the wrong angle, they fail to create the right sense of „scale“ if you know what I mean. Scenes of a sexual nature tend to work the best if you bring the „camera“ in close, show the breath of the characters, the girl blushing, sweat, the subtle changes in the facial expressions. Step up your game in terms of animation, this is important. Another thing is that the character models don&#039;t really work all that well in regards to this. Artists have different strengths and while the girls manage to look pretty in a normal setting, I didn&#039;t really feel like they managed to get much more attractive when it came to the ecchi content. The faces and general body shape are done beautifully, but the naked bodies themselves lack desirability in my opinion. This is really one of the aspects where the author seems to fail, though that may be a hard word. You can&#039;t be good at everything and while Senri Akatsuki, the author, appears to be excellent at writing dialogue and delivering drama in an effective way, this seems to be one of his weaknesses, which is probably why ecchi scenes aren&#039;t that prevalent in the first place. Then again, I haven&#039;t read the source material, so this is just speculation on my part, maybe it&#039;s something that was lost in adaptation, I wouldn&#039;t know. Still, I have to judge what I see and I can&#039;t deny that I feel a little disappointed over Bahamut&#039;s lack of sexual intensity, especially considering that it is tagged as ecchi.<br />
<br />
But despite these problems, I still have to say that I enjoyed Bahamut Chronicle a lot. The designs are nice, the effort the production team put into this is far above the average, the fights look great and the dialogue is slick, which makes for a lot of fun interactions between the characters. Plus it&#039;s far less cringey than many among its immediate kin, which goes a long way for me. The girls themselves are fine, though hardly exemplary, with Krulcifer being the clear stand out. I&#039;d even exclude her from my previous point of criticism, as some of her scenes were legitimately „hot“ in addition to making me laugh quite a few times. It&#039;s hardly one of my favourites from its genre, but I can&#039;t deny that I had a fun time nonetheless. And isn&#039;t that what counts most? I can understand if someone were to say that they don&#039;t agree with my assessment of this series, but that doesn&#039;t mean that you can just disregard it by simply saying „showz bohring“. I have to reiterate: Even a genre as simple as this needs to be understood and have its entries judged based on their merits and how well an individual series holds up in comparison. For some reason people don&#039;t seem to understand this. Hell, I have even heard people say that a show like this can&#039;t be discussed at length, seeing how it doesn&#039;t have the depth for it. Well, I just wrote a 6,000 word review on one such series. Is that long enough for you? For reference: That&#039;s about the same amount of words as the four top rated reviews for Boku dake ga Inai Machi, a supposedly deep show, have combined. And I probably could have gone on for way longer if I had felt like it, did some research and wrote this over the course of a week or so. There are plenty of things to dislike about Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut, especially if you&#039;re not the biggest fan of the genre, I won&#039;t deny that, but that doesn&#039;t mean that you can just instantly pass it off as crap. This kind of behaviour isn&#039;t tolerated in regards to any other genre and it shouldn&#039;t be tolerated here. Every show deserves to be looked at in detail, the harem genre and Bahamut Chronicle in particular are no exception.<br />
<br />
In conclusion: Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle works well. That&#039;s about as accurately as I can put it. The content isn&#039;t exactly great, but the execution is good enough to make it better than your average battle harem. This is a very well done show, no doubt about it. Was it a fantastic series? No, definitely not. I wouldn&#039;t even dare to use the word „good“ in connection with it. But it&#039;s without a doubt better than the average set by its genre. Moreover, I can&#039;t deny that this was one of the shows I was looking forward to the most on a week to week basis this last season. And that&#039;s got to be worth something. A treat for fans of the genre, nothing more, nothing less.

    This anime is a ecchi, action, harem and school genre, all these genres together result in an anime style that usually do not please the audience, that&#039;s the big problem here. When you first see this anime you may think &quot;Yeah, this is the kind of cliche anime that every anime season has&quot;, but in my opinion you are wrong if you thought that, personally I was wrong too, I admit, I thought it was the same cliche of always, but it ended up being an anime way more interesting.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in a fictionary world, where there are ancient weapons, named Drag-Ride that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214789">
        are ancient mechanical weapons. Five years ago, the protagonist, named Lux Arcadia, was the prince of the Empire, and he also was known as the strongest Drag-Knight, the Empire was destroyed due to a revolt, now Lux is known as the &quot;Weakest Undefeated&quot;, the Drag-Knight who doesn&#039;t attack. Due to some reasons Lux ends up entering a girl&#039;s school that raises Drag-Knights.<br />
<br />
This is the story, not bad thought, if it was a little more serious I think it could&#039;ve been an anime that would please more audience than this, one problem is how ridiculous things end up happening and how all the girls want so bad the protagonist, but if you think about it, it&#039;s very common in the harem anime genres, not saying that it explains why, I think if a harem is built in the correct way it can be good, sadly it wasn&#039;t the case.<br />
<br />
The art of the anime has many 3D aspects, which may be a little unpleasant for some people, some parts I think the art was very strange and bad, but nothing that displeased me so much, the art was most part of the time OK, the fighting scenes were all OK too.<br />
<br />
About the sound, I can&#039;t really say if it was good or bad, it didn&#039;t caught my attention enough to make an opinion, so I will just say it&#039;s OK too, I also liked the OP, it gets in your head, the ED was also very good, singed by the group nano.RIPE that I personally like very much.<br />
<br />
If I have to say something about the characters is that, yes they are cliche, there are all of the types of girls that almost every harem anime has, but that is almost a standard of harem animes. So I really think that the characters are not bad at all, I liked even some of the supporting characters, maybe more than some main characters, lol. They all have some interesting story about their pasts, and their personalities and ways of acting didn&#039;t displeased me at all.<br />
<br />
If I have to choose if I enjoyed it or not, I would really say I enjoyed, the beggining may not catch your attention, even I thought about dropping it in the beggining, but I don&#039;t regret not dropping it, if it gets a second season in the future I will watch, if you dropped and are reading this, I advise you to give it another chance, you may end up liking it, just like me.<br />

    I started this show back when it first started airing, because I was bored. I&#039;ve seen most of the big name harem and ecchi series, and figured &quot;I may as well try this.&quot;. Mecha isn&#039;t really my thing, but the fact that this series is a Mecha isn&#039;t even what makes it bad. There may be light spoilers in here, but honestly, this show doesn&#039;t even have much of a story to begin with, and I can only imagine one thing that could be spoiled, and it really isn&#039;t even that major.<br />
<br />
Story: 2 <br />
     This series really had no overall story.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214651">
        It just had mini-arcs that comprised the whole thing, and then one antagonist that wasn&#039;t really explained well at all. The series starts off with the protagonist conveniently falling into a girl&#039;s bath. And whadaya know, it&#039;s the most important girl in the kingdom! He then has to fight her for some reason to gain entry into a girl&#039;s only school to learn how to use his mech. Lets not forget that he is the biggest badass in the kingdom, and singlehandedly overthrew a regime, literally a legend among people. For reasons unknown he has to go to school.<br />
     Naturally, their fight gets interrupted, queue the &quot;evil&quot; in the show: the Abyss. They really aren&#039;t explained very well either. In the beginning, they seem to have their own free will, since they have no tactics whatsoever, yet later on in the show they exist solely to be used by people who have certain flutes. And there are multiple flutes, which makes it quite easy for people to control them (somehow). Every time one type of enemy gets stale, they get an upgrade, From normal Abyss, to big scary Abyss, to Giant ass fortress.<br />
<br />
     Also of note, for reasons unknown, I can count on one hand the number of males who could use a &quot;Drag-Ride&quot;. Why is it only females? Why is it a female only school? How do the few guys that do know how to use a Drag-Ride learn in the first place when even Lux was given such a negative reaction upon trying to get into the only school ever talked about in the entire show?<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
     I&#039;m no art critic, but I liked the way it looked. It wasn&#039;t as good as Phantom World by any stretch, but it was fluid, and looked nice. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
     The OP is bad. Starts off like it&#039;s going to be really intense, then drops into a random electro-pop conglomeration with poorly translated english words thrown in for flavor, like &quot;fight for the sky!&quot;. ED is decent, but generic. The Sound effects however are where this show really shines. Every time a character pulls their sword out, my ears have a mini orgasm, and explosions are nice and crisp. A female voices Lux, but honestly, that didn&#039;t make the slightest difference to me. In fact, I wouldn&#039;t have even noticed if I hadn&#039;t read it in another review a while back. Other voice actors are alright, nothing stood out as exceptionally good, or exceptionally bad, so I can&#039;t complain.<br />
<br />
Character: 1<br />
     This show has the worst character cast that I have ever seen. Boring main character, generic tropes for every girl in his harem, etc. <br />
        Lux: Main character, has no backbone except to &quot;Protect his friends&quot;, never goes on the offensive. His nickname because of this is the &quot;Weakest Undefeated&quot;. Is completely clueless about how girls work, and even when he has opportunities right in front of him, he drops them. He lacks confidence in anything but his goal to protect his friends, which makes him lose so many opportunities. He could have been laid many times throughout the season, by any of the people in his harem, yet instead he gets a total of 3 kisses, which aren&#039;t dramatic at all, and very anti-climatic, since he freaks out after each one.<br />
        Airi: Lux&#039;s little sister, because what show would be complete if the main character didn&#039;t have a sister that rarely does anything except push him forward in his determination? Has barely any screen time, manages to be condescending in spite of this. <br />
        Lisesharte: The princess that he falls into the bathtub with. tsundere, quickly goes full dere in less than a full episode, and then just manages to push herself away from him due to her own stupid decisions, because you can&#039;t have a relationship in a harem.<br />
        Philphie: the kuudere childhood friend. Eyecandy is pretty much her sole purpose in the show, barely even an interest in his harem. She&#039;s too apathetic to care if Lux goes for her or anyone else.<br />
        Krulcifer: The only good character in the show. She is the only one you can&#039;t always predict, and that is the only redeeming factor characterwise. Still not enough to pull the rating upto a 2.<br />
<br />
     Those are the only characters I even know the name of. There is a great deal more of them, and none of them are really of any consequence. A brown haired chick that serves no purpose other than pushing the members of his harem closer to him. A black haired girl who is emotionless. I know I&#039;m forgetting characters, but clearly they weren&#039;t important enough to remember anyways. Most of them serve a single purpose as a plot device, and the only characters you get a backstory for are Krulcifer and Philpie. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
     This show was one of those where you watch it, in full knowledge of exactly everything that is going to happen before it actually does. It is nothing if not predictable. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
     Unless you&#039;re trying to get someone introduced to all of the common harem-genre antics, I would not recommend this show to anyone. I was quite looking forward to just getting it over with at the end. I could recommend many other shows that do harem better than this, and even Infinite:Stratos did harem better than this. It&#039;s no good as an ecchi, since the only ecchi is a bath scene at the very beginning, a 5 second scene in the second episode, one back massage with Celes and then Phi&#039;s boobs constitute the rest of the ecchi throughout the rest of the show. It&#039;s not good as an action, because there is too much drama involved with personal relationships. <br />
<br />
TL;DR Avoid this show unless you are out of any other show you could possibly think of, or if you are introducing your friends to the nuances of weak-character harems. <br />

    Sorry if I used wrong words or some grammar errors, that&#039;s because English isn&#039;t my primary language.<br />
<br />
Ok, here is the review :<br />
<br />
When I see this for the first time, I was thinking about Asterisk and Failed Knight because they have a similar intro, but I don&#039;t really mind it. But after completed this anime, I was very disappointed. Many things came up and make this anime more worse, fot example the last battle was good actually, but some things came and almost make me stopped watching fot a while, but I finally managed to watch it until end. <br />
<br />
For the story, it&#039;s bad. It&#039;s really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214670">
        bad. I can&#039;t tell how bad it was by word. Our mc, have a divine drag ride and supposed to be a strong character, in the last battle I think he would use all of his power, but no. His power were useless, well not completely useless but it&#039;s useless. That&#039;s same with other characters, nobody used their power to the max, that&#039;s make me it worse. Beside, the story is pretty hard to understand but I don&#039;t really paying attention into it.<br />
<br />
Intro and ending were good, the songs were nice, it also easy to remember. The voice act is awesome, I like it. The sound effect is great,  No complaint from me, but overall I don&#039;t really like it because some background songs weren&#039;t fit with the show. But that&#039;s okay, I don&#039;t mind it.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s an average show for me, because it have bad side and good side. I recommend this to you if you here only for the harem genre (it&#039;s not contain alot of ecchi). But if you looking for a good battle or something other than harem, you wouldn&#039;t be like this. The ending is a cliffhanger (this is an announcement, I won&#039;t tell you why did I wrote it) and I think it would be good if this has a second season.
