Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to the Kamogawa boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo&#039;s classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo&#039;s journey to the top of the boxing world begins. [Written by MAL Rewrite]">

</div><h2><div class="floatRightHeader"><a href="/dbchanges.php?aid=263&t=synopsis" style="font-weight: normal;">Edit</a></div>Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description">Makunouchi Ippo has been bullied his entire life. Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to the Kamogawa boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo&#039;s classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo&#039;s journey to the top of the boxing world begins.<br />

    First, let me say that I\&#039;m not a fan of boxing. In fact, I pretty much hate the sport. Honestly, who likes seeing people getting their head beat in every day?<br />
<br />
With that being said, this series is brilliantly done. There\&#039;s comedy, romance, and plenty, plenty, plenty of plot. Follow Ippo as he grows as a person and as a professional boxer. You\&#039;ll laugh, and you\&#039;ll probably cry here or there. The fact that I don\&#039;t even like boxing never came in to play. You\&#039;ll probably find yourself doing some jabs here and there while watching the show too. It\&#039;s that captivating.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are awesome.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10">
        Takamura, Kimura and Aoki are all equally hilarious. Each has a distinct personality that make them all very lovable. They also support Ippo as he meets his trials of boxing and life. <br />
<br />
Definitely give this series a try. You won\&#039;t be disappointed with the 76 episodes. In fact, you\&#039;ll probably end up reading the manga because you don\&#039;t want it to stop!

    &quot;What? 76 episodes of… boxing?  76 episodes set in a small square ring?  Yeah, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had no idea.  <br />
<br />
What makes this anime special is undoubtedly the characters.  How each character is so likeable, so original, and so fully developed that you end up understanding, caring, and rooting for them in the end.  How even the ones that only last an episode, even Ippo&#039;s opponents can be given such plausible and staggering backstories that you might actually find yourself siding against the main hero for a match or two.  And how these characters are just so serious with their lives

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31888">
        that you really feel it, and you end up believing that such a world could actually exist out there.     <br />
<br />
You know you love an anime when it drives you to shout, to hold your breath, and to jump right out of your seat.  You know you love an anime when the thrill makes your spine tingle so much that you actively root and cheer and punch the air in victory as if you were right there ringside. You know you love it when you marathon through 15 episodes one night, and wake the next morning only to continue watching.  And even after 76 episodes and two bonuses, you can&#039;t let go.  They&#039;ve already wrapped you up in that world, those characters, their lives, their ambitions, and suddenly… suddenly you&#039;re expected to just leave?  <br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
You know you love an anime when you&#039;re showing it to a friend and you somehow end up watching the entire thing again with him/her.  And you still shout, you still laugh, you still find yourself out of your seat punching the air the second, the third, the sixth time you&#039;ve seen it. <br />
<br />
And you can&#039;t stop smiling.  Because you get to live in their world again. <br />

    Hajime no ippo based on boxing manga written and illustrated by George Morikawa. A 75 episode anime adaptation titled Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting! was produced by Madhouse, Nippon Television and VAP, directed by Satoshi Nishimura and ran on the Nippon Television Network from October 2000 to March 2002<br />
<br />
The story itself has two main parts. Part one which Ippo is chasing the eastern feather weight championship and part two which Ippo decides to continue his career as a boxer. In the first arc which is the best arc, the story processing and the character development are done in absolute best way that a show can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227532">
        offer. For example after the main character Ippo join up the Kamogawa gym, you&#039;ll surprised how amazing Ippo and his new friends overcome the consecutive challenges with each and every one of these challenges is tougher than the previous and most of &#039;em are deadly which can simply destroy Ippo’s dream. After watching this anime you won’t believe how just 75-episodes could really change your life.<br />
<br />
Well, Hajime-no Ippo is not like any typical anime but this show has a well organized story, realistic settings even if you guys don’t like sports anime, don’t worry about this because Hajime is nothing like any ordinary sport anime you might think, don’t you fool by the cover or by the main story because the whole thing is deeper than that. in my entire life I never witness something like these fantastic drama-story which barely I hold my tears back. also not only this anime has the most poignant drama ever but also you&#039;ll experience the most cheerful excitement ever. actually I never felt like this since my last (Death Note), and who cares about death-note anymore, at least Hajime-no Ippo make sense <br />
<br />
However, Hajime no Ippo isn’t just a solid straight punch into your heart, furthermore there are lots of relieving moments (both romantic and comedy) almost in every episode which you’ll never forget. Simply, this Hajime no Ippo is the best example of how successful anime was in that period of time.<br />
<br />
Story <br />
Ippo is a weird little poor guy bullied everyday at the school. He is different (strange) and not popular. most of time he is busy helping his mother with the family business and that is the main reason he couldn’t make friends in the class. Ippo is weak (not physically but mentally). Ippo suffered dealing with life mates (classmates) and because of his natural condition no one in the class respect him furthermore they always make fun of him, humiliating him and more. Still that is not the biggest problem because physical pain is nothing comparing to the pain in someone’s heart. Ippo realize that something must change and for the sake of that change everything is sacrificeable. One day Ippo caught up by a professional boxer being bullied, the man help out Ippo, soon as that moment Ippo recognize that this is the best opportunity for the change. It’s never too late to become strong, at least same as that boxer but he is not sure if he got what it takes to gain that much power or even if he can stand for his own self. Ippo knows what kind a situation and how much hardworking he must offer to restore things back to normal. Finally Ippo join to a boxing gym after lot of hard work, patient and most importance a will to overcome his weaknesses because of his natural talent but also with his ultimate desire.<br />
<br />
Back to Ippo’s life before he join-up the gym he used to help the family business carrying weighs for customers and his ordinary school life where he has been kicked at most of the days, as he not realizes that but it was lot of help for him and because of that he don’t have to start the whole training process from the scratch rather more he can take the strongest knockouts in the ring same as he bear it in the school and that’s something great, because usual people would collapse at the same circumstances but Ippo overcome the whole thing and start a new life. After a while Ippo manages a pro boxer license and that is just the first step. Finally Ippo is going to compete in official matches which only the best will survive. The feather weight Rookie championship chart finally announced and Information comes at Kamogawa gym about Ippo’s opponents and their fight strategies, techniques furthermore their background. Ippo have to train more than he often. while these feather weight matches are on the line/ more important he should figure out how to stop (block) his opponents inventing new strategies and sometimes depending on his fight spirit, at the same time he should keep his mind clear and relax and win each and every match in this championship<br />
<br />
Characters; the most faithful characters<br />
Each and every character in these Hajime has an amazing background story and a big reason that keeps him fighting, risking their lives in order to achieve their –selfish- dreams. Hajime no Ippo’s characters are not like any other ordinary characters, they are ultimate super characters. The story itself is processing the character development. So, the more you understand these characters the more you’ll enjoy. Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
Ippo Makunouchi: He lives with his mother, Hiroko, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business. Ippo used to get bullied and picked on by others in his school. Dreams: (What it means to be strong?) the only question that Ippo has in his mind and he will fight until that question answered.<br />
Ichiro Miyata: he is very skilled outboxer with a cool demeanor that specializes in counter punches. He uses the same boxing style that his father used. Dreams: Miyata decided to take on his father’s style of boxing to prove its worth on the world stage<br />
Ryo Mashiba (psycho boy): known as Shinigami -God of Death-, he is a very quiet and scary, also, he is one of the strongest boxers in the whole Tournament. His parents died in a car accident. Dreams: he box for prize money all to support his beloved younger sister, Kumi. (so on)<br />
<br />
Simply, each and every character in this anime is an anther living example of how great they accomplish this masterpiece anime.<br />
<br />
Animation <br />
Well, the whole story settled in few backgrounds and that is for sure a brilliant way to produce such a wonderful art at same time it’s economic for both the creator and the audience. While the producer reduce his work for not drawing so many backgrounds the audience themselves will find it so easy, not confusing and comfortable taking the whole time thinking and relating the actions of these characters and how the whole story processes, not worrying about any other details. Also Hajime no Ippo has one of the best character drawings in the entire anime universe.<br />
<br />
Sound <br />
Well, I’ not the guy who can give you a certain description about this but all I can say is “it was great”, whatever it was piano or other instruments it was really awesome specially the emotional track which takes you a deep journey inside yourself keeping you excited all the time. However, the music of this Hajime no Ippo series were used to accentuate the mood and the fight spirit of the characters. <br />
Openings<br />
Three straight opening themes and other three closing themes, and my favourite is the first opening which I’ still listening to it right now... (Ryuusei no ai ga kimi ni...isshun no hikari okuterru...yeeeeeeah!) <br />
Opening Theme Songs (Under Star/Episodes 1-25 ,Inner Light/Episodes 26-52 by Shocking Lemon, Tumbling Dice /Episodes 53-76 by Tsuneo Imahori).Ending Theme Songs (Yuuzora no Kamihikouki/Episodes 1-25 by Mori Naoya, &quot;360°&quot;/ Episodes 26-52 by Mori Naoya, Eternal Loop/ Episodes 53-75 by Saber Tiger)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment <br />
The first 28 episodes were the greatest episodes that I’ve seen in years while the rest of the episodes were wonderful and awesome too. However, the most important thing about this anime that I’ve enjoyed so much is that each and every episode has its own story and something new is learned about both fighters. Probably after every episode you’ll go crazy throwing punches around here and there and maybe in the worst case you’ll end up as professional boxer but who cares just go enjoy and don’t forget to cheer up Ippo all the way (Rebound! Nice shot! Rebound! Nice shot! Rebound! Nice shot! Rebound! Nice shot! Rebound! Nice shot! ….. Rebound! Nice shot!)<br />

    The anime makes use of every character it introduces and develops them very convincingly and you can really connect to them. Such as Ippo in gaining more confidence and motivation, Takamura in wanting to become a champion and a hero, and Miyata wanting to prove that his father&amp;rsquo;s boxing style is the best. The characters all have back-stories of why they became fighters but they still live lives in certain ways you can still relate to them and they all have every day issues as real boxers would have such as Takamura&amp;rsquo;s weight control. As for the pacing, yes, the anime is long and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6543">
        manga is 10 times longer, but still evenly paced and I feel the intention after getting to a certain point is that Morikawa-sensei wants to tell a life story in the same way Araki-sensei does with Jojo and you really start to feel that and you really feel the character&amp;rsquo;s grow and there are times you can emotionally react or care what could happen to that character.<br />
<br />
The art style is very faithful to that of the style of the manga, except I felt that the bodies looked blockier and more massive than they needed to be in comparison to it. Plus, the venues such as Kourakuen Hall and the surrounding environments are well accurately represented because I&amp;rsquo;ve been there before on a number of occasions and fought in a judo tournament there so I thought that was pretty cool. I really love the training sequences with Ippo and he comes up with crazy methods and is an animal. The only real life athlete I can think of that compares to Ippo&amp;rsquo;s training ethic and regime is UFC fighter Sean Sherk. <br />
<br />
And now lets get down to the heart and soul of this anime, and that is the fights. As someone who can&amp;rsquo;t stand the trendy over the top repetitive action you see in some animes today, this is definitely a liberation. This anime proves you don&amp;rsquo;t need fire balls or bullet time or any of that trendy bullshit to make a great fight. This is an anime that truly accurately portrays the technique, excitement, and intensity of the real sport of boxing by implementing all these real life moves and fighting styles. 1st example is Ippo. He is based on a prime Mike Tyson who uses the peek a boo stance, worked the body, and had an effective jab once he got on the inside. Sendo Takeshi is based on Razor Ruddock with his smash punch which is a mix between a hook and an uppercut. And Mashiba is based on Thomas Hearns where he uses his freakish reach to use a crazy jabbing system. And Hayami, you think his shotgun is unrealistic? Before Ali got suspended, he had incredible speed, 10x faster than the Ali who came back who was still pretty fast. There&amp;rsquo;s a video of Ali out there where he landed 15 punches in 3 seconds. And you know the old saying of how styles make fights? Well, that saying is applied very well in this anime and applies it very well and is just poetry in motion.<br />
<br />
<br />
The dub seriously sucks. Takamura sounds like Adam Carolla. Ippo just doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit. Miyata sounds like a chain smoker. And the sound quality and the overall execution is just as bad as GTO&amp;rsquo;s dub where it sounded like they hired 5 voice actors. Avoid the dub at all cost. But once again, time to give you more info on the seiyuu cast. It&amp;rsquo;s very interesting to note that the voice of Kaoru from Prince of Tennis, Kiyasu Kohei plays Ippo himself. Despite that deep and hissing voice is the nerdy and assuming Ippo. And one of my personal favorites Tomokazu Seki plays my favorite character Miyata. He does a great job of being that lone wolf kind of character and knows how to keep his cool. And I truly felt that Takagi Wataru, the voice of Onizuka from GTO was born to play Aoki. And Onosaka Masaya the voice of Momoshiro in Prince of Tennis and Vash the Stampede from Trigun was also born to play Sendo. If anything, this is an anime that is truly meant to be watched in Japanese. <br />
<br />
The music is also pretty awesome and a quality you can&amp;rsquo;t deny which you can&amp;rsquo;t get in manga obviously. The opening themes Under Star and Inner Light have a heavy intense feel to it where you can really emotionally react to the clips in the opening theme and to the scenes whenever presented as a background song in the anime itself. And I like how the ending themes 360 and Yuuzora no Kamihikouki gives a different kind of emotional reaction where it&amp;rsquo;s more about relating to the characters and the hardships they go through, but yet there&amp;rsquo;s this huge reward waiting for them at the end. <br />
<br />
The only significant flaw I would say is that they ended this anime where the excitement truly begins in the manga. I say Ippo conquering Japan is just only the beginning because after that, the other characters get more focused and the development gets deeper and the fights get better. But overall, this anime has excellent themes in finding something you&amp;rsquo;re good at, and sticking to it and always keep believing. The good news is, you really don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a boxing fan or have any knowledge of boxing to really get into this anime. This anime will probably do it for you. After awhile, you start saying to yourself, how would Ippo do against Manny Pacquiao, or how would Takamura do against Roy Jones, Jr. So it really sparks interest in that kind of way from what I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced. Also, this anime truly accurately represents the Japanese feel of boxing itself. If you ever watch Japanese fighters, they are very exciting to watch. They love to go at it and fight with every last ounce of breath. I really have no experience competing in actual boxing since I&amp;rsquo;m more of a traditional martial arts kind of guy, but I only took up boxing for awhile just to improve my hands and when you&amp;rsquo;re training, you just got that tempting feeling to do the moves from the series and even train like Ippo because the things he does, you can go out and try for yourself for real since you can&amp;rsquo;t fly or shoot fire balls. I say that alone is magically captivating. If you want an anime free of virtually every stereotype and clich&amp;eacute;, this one is for you.<br />
