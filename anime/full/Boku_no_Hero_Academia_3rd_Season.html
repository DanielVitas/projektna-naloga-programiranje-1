    “This season is about 2 lads,<br />
<br />
The symbol of hope &amp; the symbol of victory,<br />
<br />
One is introvert &amp; the other is mad,<br />
<br />
And both are always in each other’s memory,<br />
<br />
They were friends in their childhood,<br />
<br />
But both turned to be an obstacle in each other’s road,<br />
<br />
One is a hero that’s always praised,<br />
<br />
And the other is a hero that’s unrecognized,<br />
<br />
Aggressive, prideful and a bully boy,<br />
<br />
Who sees the other as a nothing, but an annoy,<br />
<br />
Cheerful, shy and a dreamer youth,<br />
<br />
Who can pay anything just to rescue someone, even if the price is a tooth,<br />
<br />
Both are like water &amp; fire,<br />
<br />
The only common thing was the person whom they admire,<br />
<br />
And becoming his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290335">
        successor, was their desire,<br />
<br />
Hence, they had to fight,<br />
<br />
Deku vs Kacchan ….…. With all of their might!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Boku no Hero academia is one of the most popular shounen animes in the recent years, it acquired it’s fame mostly cause of season 2 which was in 2017, and today, the 3rd season is officially finished. <br />
<br />
Story :<br />
The story in this season continues the track of the pervious prequels, no much new things to say, however, the story was progressing throughout this season, The U.A students were honing their quirks, fought against villains and had the hero’s license exam too.<br />
<br />
Characters :<br />
Now, that’s will be long a lil bit. In my opinion, one of the strongest points in BnHA is the characters. Throughout this season, we got many new MVP characters and well-development scenes too. Deku surpassed himself and changed his fight style, Kirishma was the most caring one for Bakugo, All might showed us that heroes can be badass and cool and finally, the best character in this season was .. Bakugo! <br />
Hate or love Bakugo, it doesn’t matter. But we all must agree that Bakugo is one of the most unique characters in BnHA. Bakugo didn’t turn into “Sasuke v2.0” who accepts to be a villain just to beat deku. No, Bakugo may seems like a villain but in reality he’s just an angry boy who wants to be a cool hero no matter what. Moreover, Bakugo’s breaking down scene was stellar. He showed us that despite the “rough” ,”Aggressive” and “bully” side of him. He still has the humane side or the soft side deep inside of him, he has feelings too and can feel pain. In addition, Bakugo &amp; Deku could understand each other a bit and they finally became true rivals, which can be highlighted as a significant development in their characters and in the story.<br />
On the other hand, we’ve got a large cast of villains, some are blend and others are interesting. We have an edgy dabi, a transgender dude, a ninja turtle fighter, a horny toga and deadpool v2.0. However, there’re 3 villains that are interesting in this season, which are : deadpo-.. I mean, Twice. Who had an epic monologue in episode 24, stating that Heroes save the good people only, despite that sometimes there’re “insane” people who just want someone to understand them, but sadly this doesn’t happen, hence these kind of people turn into villains as they can find some people who can understand them, which gives a depth in the realism of the story. Overhaul, who looked like a real badass villain. And finally, All for one !<br />
All for one, basically resembles the idea of “A Villain is another one’s hero”. All for one was the dad-figure for shigaraki. This man’s ambitions are so vague and unclear, he is intelligent, has an unlimited power, lived for many &amp; many years, but his goals are not 100% clear to the audiences. This villain caught my attention at once actually. And it seems that … Shigaraki is going to have a major development to be a real villain with an ideology in the near future. <br />
We got also some new characters like the big 3 who will take a big role in season 4. And there’re new characters from other schools like Inasa and Camie etc ..<br />
<br />
ALSO DON’T FORGET BAKUGO’S THICC MUM !!!<br />
<br />
Soundtrack :<br />
To be honest, this is the weakest point in BnHA s3. Don’t get me wrong, there’re many good and emotional OSTs, but the real problem is, the choice of the OSTs ! During the most of the fights in BnHA, the used OSTs in the background somehow don’t suit with the fight. <br />
The first OP of season 3 (ODD Futre) was lit, honestly I think it’s the best among all BnHA’s OPs. The 2nd OP (Make my Story) wasn’t that good. The EDs are lame anyway. <br />
<br />
Animation :<br />
The animation in BnHA is medium, not perfect nor bad, although, during the fights it is something else, Bones tend to use their budget in the worthy fights only. I think it is a clever way to not waste their budget and make the fans addicted to the epic fight scenes in this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment :<br />
The first cour of this season was astonishing, I was tense while watching each episode, and I re-watched most of these episodes even. Some episodes were pure masterpiece like Episode 4, 9, 10, 11. We had many emotional scenes, action scenes, tension scenes and even some sad scenes. However, every anime has its ups and downs, the 2nd cour was seriously a big down. The License exam arc was long and predictable in most of times. Bones even added a stupid filler in the middle of the arc. I felt that I was watching another anime actually, but after this arc, we returned back to the awesome episodes of BnHA, starting from Deku Vs Bakugo, Twice’s monologue, the revealing of new badass characters, smoothing down the road for the dark “internship arc” in season 4.<br />
<br />
Overall :<br />
Some people compare the previous seasons to this one, In my opinion, every season has its ups and downs, this season started like a bombshell but dropped down slowly. But it returned back to it’s prime in the last couple of episodes. This season was manly about fighting villains. Showing how the young lads are now grown enough to be in danger and that they have to improve their skills tho. This season was boring in some episodes and very splendid in other episodes. Some people say that BnHA is an overrated series. however, in the last couple of years, the number of good action animes are decreasing gradually cause of the low quality and bad adaption, so an anime like BnHA is like a diamond that brings good sells to the studio.  I hope that season 4 surpass the flaws in season 1, 2 and 3 and deliver to us the perfect quality of an action anime. <br />

    For the third consecutive time Boku no Hero Academia returned in the spring season, and for the third time brought a season with a thematically cohesive story, with no plothole or loose end. The new characters are incredibly charismatic, at the same time they have not forgotten to develop the old ones. There are 25 episodes well setup, animated and directed with breathtaking scenes alongside a flawless and chilling soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Boku no Hero Academia is by no means innovative, but that&#039;s no problem, why? Because he does not want to be innovative. The author of Boku no Hero Academia (Horikoshi Kohei) has complete awareness that his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290329">
        show is cliché, and even with all the success that his show has achieved he does not allow himself to be led by egocentrism as other authors. Remember the tireless training arcs of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, the secondary characters barely harnessed in &quot;Naruto&quot; ?, the exhaustive and large arcs of &quot;One Piece&quot; ?, the thematic lack that &quot;Bleach&quot; had? Well, Boku no Hero Academia has none of those flaws. I like to say that Boku no Hero Academia is the best cliche of all time, the show follows all the formulas and patterns of battle-shounens that we are accustomed to see in all those years, but Boku no Hero Academia executes all these formulas and standards in the best possible way and with excellence.<br />
<br />
I recommend Boku no Hero Academia for ANYONE, it&#039;s a very easy show to sympathize, understand and consume. Probably the only people who will not like this show are the famous &quot;EDGELORDS&quot; teenagers who are good enough to watch a &quot;cliché and childish&quot; anime.<br />
<br />
          *Forest Training Camp Arc (episodes 01-07)<br />
The whole lesson of this Arc is already very clear from the first moment we are introduced to the new characters, it is a valid lesson, but very weak in the sense that almost no discussion is generated.<br />
Thanks to the editing of the direction the episodes are very consistent and prevents the viewer has hasty conclusions of the subjects. If it had not been for her, the lesson of this arc might have become just a silly revenge for the unfortunate covenience that is the villain: Muscular.<br />
<br />
At the end of the Arc everything that is established are tensions between different points of view and emotions among the students of class 1-A. Tensions that end up shocking because everyone has a common goal, and this is something very cool, interesting and intelligent for a manga considered by many to be just &quot;a cliché&quot;.<br />
<br />
          *Hideout Raid Arc (episodes 08-12)<br />
Again praising the setup of the episodes, all that the beginning of this arc does is to build an expectation of victory and then overthrow it, and with this overthrow we have possibly the best episode of an anime this year.<br />
<br />
The All Might fight is a very intense and very exciting fight for a series of resources to make the emotion maximize. This episode only works because when watching you are not only feeling what All Might is feeling, you are feeling what others peoples are feeling when watching All Might fight, then the episode constantly cuts to everyone who is watching the fight. This feature having a function very similar to the laughter of sitcom&#039;s. It is impossible for a person not to feel excited about this episode.<br />
<br />
The sensation of this episode is incredible, its a sensation few animes can provide. Probably the last time I felt this was when I was 10 when I &quot;helped&quot; the Goku to do the &quot;Genkidama&quot;.<br />
<br />
          *Provisional Hero License Exam Arc (episodes 13-23)<br />
This Arc is not so great, the exam is not the most ingenious thing in the world and its climax is not the most exciting thing of all. But this arc is thematically cohesive and its existence is important, necessary, marking the beginning of a new saga about obscure times in that universe.<br />
<br />
                      (WARNING. FROM HERE THE REVIEW WILL OWN MINOR SPOILERS)<br />
Now let&#039;s go to what matters: Deku x Kacchan 2 (episode 23). I will not waste time talking about how well animated and directed this fight was, in fact I will limit myself and speak exclusively of the incredibly well written and complex character that is the Bakugou.<br />
<br />
I already start saying that this is not a thesis, but I will use references (all listed there at the end of the analysis) to support what I am talking about. And this here is an analysis of a CHARACTER, not a PERSON. Which brings us to the first point:<br />
<br />
When someone states that a character is well-written or well-developed, this is directly related to an assessment at the narrative level of the script. Like a CHARACTER is not like a person, just like a character is not agreeing with all his actions.<br />
<br />
In How Fiction Works, James Wood reads: &quot;[...] artists should not ask us to understand characters we do not approve of - or at least not until they have clearly and rigorously condemned them. The idea that we can feel that &#039;disgusting factor&#039; and at the same time see life through their eyes; that the mere fact that we leave ourselves to enter fields beyond our daily experience can in itself constitute a lesson in morality and solidarity to be out of the reach of the critics [...]&quot;<br />
<br />
He defends the idea that good characters are not (or need be) necessarily good people, and that the mistakes they make do not compromise their role in the narrative. And what makes a character a GOOD character? Pro Forster, is when the character, even if it has not been explained, is explicable, or gives us the feeling of &quot;real&quot;:<br />
<br />
&quot;... a work of art, which is governed by its own laws, which are not the same as those of daily life, and a character is real when he lives by these laws. [...] They are not real because they resemble us (though they may look, in fact), but because they are convincing. &quot;<br />
<br />
And if we&#039;re talking about a convincing character, then the subject is character building. Many people get confused there because they think character building is the same as character development when it is not.<br />
<br />
In Screenplay, Syd Field says this: &quot;The inner life of your character happens from birth until the moment the story begins. It&#039;s a process that shapes the character. Your character&#039;s outer life happens from the moment the story begins to completion. It&#039;s a process that reveals the character. &quot;<br />
<br />
To build a character is to take into account the two. Both the past, which will explain why he does what is done and why he has to do X or Y; as the present, there is no more age to achieve this goal.<br />
<br />
To Syd Field, a feature is defined by biography, attitude, personality, behavior, point of view and dramatic dramatic. And the water will chain every aspect of Bakugo into each of them.<br />
<br />
Soon in the biography, it has already been discarded with a first easy way out: you have a very asshole character, a solution for the audience that likes him is a nanny character, and a &quot;son of him, look how he suffered.&quot; So, you will not feel sorry for the Bakugo because a childhood of it was SWAN. He had a fucking whim, everyone complimented him, was the schoolboy and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, HE WAS BULLYING WITH THE PROTAGONIST. Fucking scrotum right? Only that makes sense. If the guy is in an environment where the ego is always inflated, no one questions or corrects the shit he does, it is natural that he is a real asshole. Is that his fault? Damn it, dick in the Bakugo&#039;s ass. But EXPLAIN. This is important. His year EXPLAINS why he is not present.<br />
<br />
Personality and behavior are complementary, because the former is the de facto character, and the latter as manifested in history. As for the Bakugo, the interesting side is a personality of it leads to a perspective of respect for the behavior that he himself breaks. We do not expect an arrogant, cruel boy to have a relationship as an opponent, or send a League of Villains literally not having it, but it&#039;s still the second person who cries most in the manga. This behavior is not contradictory, but rather the cause of surprise, and this causes the character to be spherical.<br />
<br />
Attitude has a see with ACTION, and that is what defines it as deuteragonist of history (because you assume it or not, it is the deuteragonist of history). The whole character has a narrative function, and is not a résumé of the protagonist. IT WAS BULLY. IT WAS YES. But he is not as hum bully (or ex-bully, however they want). He is Midoriya&#039;s rival. He acts to get what he wants, and his actions have repercussions that affect his development as a story as a whole. As his attitudes INSPIRE students to act during the provisional license test as well as inspire Midoriya himself (dictated by himself, in Deku vs. Kacchan 2).<br />
<br />
The dramatic need (or purpose, or purpose) and point of view, in his case, are related. He wants to be the number one hero and beat the villains because he was inspired by his idol, and that&#039;s what he absorbed from All Might&#039;s career. In a manga about heroes, his world view on heroism is: hero is the one who wins. What is the opposite complementary to the vision of the protagonist, who has the same idol, but what Midoriya learned and adopted as a reference is: hero is the one who saves. Neither of them is wrong, as All Might himself rightly said after they face each other, and they will YES learn from each other to get in balance.<br />
<br />
And to close the question with a simple but very efficient scheme, I will use a questionnaire &quot;created&quot; by SYD FIELD in &quot;Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting&quot; that aims to qualify how well written and constructed a character is.<br />
<br />
1. What does this character WANT?<br />
Bakugo wants to be a hero, wants to be number one and wants to defeat villains.<br />
<br />
2. What does this character NEED?<br />
First of all, he needs a provisional license to work as a trainee. Then you need a definitive license, which you will only get after all the AU school years. And to be number one he needs not only to be good, or even great, but the best hero.<br />
<br />
3. How do these wants and needs enter into CONFLICT WITH OTHERS within it?<br />
It is from here that the Bakugo shines, because if good stories are made of good conflicts, his journey alone already has a ton of conflicts. What he wants and what he needs does not match what he IS. Because he will NEVER be a hero, even more number one, being an asshole. He can not even get a provisional license because he refused to save others. He did not beat the villains when he was kidnapped. In reality, Bakugo has been collecting failures since the beginning of history. Either he matures and rethinks his own attitudes, or changes the goal. And as we saw during the kidnapping, when someone offered him a new purpose, he refused because being a hero is the dream of his life.<br />
<br />
4. How do you enter into CONFLICT with the WORLD around you?<br />
I will read &quot;world&quot; as society and villains in general, because they are two groups that influence how the universe of My Hero Academy works. From childhood, society encouraged Bakugo to achieve what he wanted without ever questioning what he needed to achieve it. But with the kidnapping, most doubted if he was going to stay true to the will to be a hero. The villains also questioned what he wanted. Because if he wanted to win, he could win being a villain in their conception. Bakugo&#039;s conflict with the world around him is that few believe that he will actually go the way he WANTS because he does not have what he NEEDS.<br />
<br />
5. How do you enter into CONFLICT with OTHER CHARACTERS?<br />
Being the asshole that he is, Bakugo collects friction with a lot of characters, but I think two sum up this question well.<br />
Against Todoroki, at the final of the sports festival, Bakugo was not nervous just because, in his view, Todoroki underestimated him as an opponent because he did not use the full potential of his own power. What Bakugo wants is to win as a hero, not just win - it has to be a fair victory. As Todoroki &quot;gave up&quot; the fight in the middle of it (we know it&#039;s more complicated than that), Bakugo was prevented from giving his all, and a fight delivered to him means nothing. That is why he refuses to accept the first place in this case, even though it is what he seeks from the beginning; and also for that reason his relationship with Todoroki remained so full of disagreements for so long, even after he went on to accept friends like Kaminari and Kirishima.<br />
The Bakugo conflict with Midoriya is the first, the longest and the most intense. Already it begins that the confrontation between them, more than physical, is ideological: the vision of the world of the two as to what it means to be a hero do not contradict, but are opposite. Moreover, the absence of communication made their disagreement drag on for years: Bakugo did not understand why Midoriya kept following him even as he tried to push the boy away using violence, did not understand that Midoriya always admired his unwavering will to to win, despite all the defects; Midoriya did not know that every time he tried to help, Bakugo interpreted the gesture as a sign that he was being despised or that he was seen as weak. That&#039;s until the two of them met again at the end of season three, and All Might said the two could learn from each other to be heroes who save and win. (This conflict of the two gives material to much text, but this one is already long enough, so you forgive my summary)<br />
<br />
6. How does this character CHANGE through these CONFLICTS and how does this change affect you?<br />
Bakugo has gone through a number of changes, major or minor, throughout history, and his learning always comes with failure. For example, after Bakugo experiences defeat for the first time against the rival, in the first season, Midoriya realizes that his behavior during the sporting festival is very different from what he was already accustomed to, since he took them all seriously and not was bragging. During the rescue, he accepts the help of his classmates and takes the hand of Kirishima, in what was described as a sign that he saw him as an equal and a friend. After the kidnapping, which was already synonymous with weakness, he witnessed the forced retirement of the idol that inspired his life goal, and this made him question his own strength and his own point of view. He blamed himself for what happened to All Might and fed the inferiority complex himself until All Might himself assured him that he was not to blame.<br />
In the scene in which he and Midoriya are cleaning the lodge as punishment, he offers a hint for his rival for the first time, and before that he sees him, FOR THE FIRST TIME, as a rival on the same level as him.<br />
<br />
7. What is the impact of this CHANGE on all others?<br />
At first we can say that the result of these gradual changes is that today he has more LMAO friends. When Kirishima realizes that Bakugo can more than shout &#039;SHINEE&#039; and is centered on what he wants, the two begin to develop the sense of equality, respect and friendship that he maintains until today. Kaminari, who at first compared Bakugo&#039;s personality with &quot;shit rotting in the sewage,&quot; his friend argued against Shishikura, because he also came closer to him as he opened up to the idea of ​​considering others not as coadjuvants but as allies. The same goes for Midoriya, and their relationship improved a lot after the fight they had, in what is now a healthy rivalry and encouraged by both.<br />
The way other characters treat and relate to Bakugo no longer has the distance that existed at the beginning. Kaminari, Kirishima, Todoroki and Sero feel comfortable enough to provoke the Bakugo or point him out in situations where he has stayed apart because they want him to participate (&quot;Do you worry, is not it? Be honest!&quot; Or &quot;Bakugo , did not you tell me that you can play drums? &quot;) And all these relationships, in addition to his rivalry with the protagonist, make him a richer, more interesting and even identifiable deuteragonist.<br />
<br />
This is it. <br />
<br />
          *Internship Arc (episodes 24-25)<br />
Well ... these two episodes are great cliffhangers for next season.<br />

    Before this, I would recommend reading my reviews of the first two seasons of Boku no Hero Academia. Many details that explain my opinion on this series in a broader sense are already covered there.<br />
<br />
This season picks up where the previous season left off, with the students preparing to go to an inevitably doomed summer training camp. The plot takes a much darker tone this season, with The League of Villains newly-emboldened by Stain&#039;s actions in season 2, and full of fresh faces. The first arc of this season gives the new villains a chance to show off what they&#039;re made of, and set up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290341">
        the league as a more immediate, tangible threat.<br />
<br />
Without spoiling too much, the following arc goes even further into developing The League of Villains, finally introducing their leader and revealing his true plan. It also sets up for a changing of the guard for both the heroes and the villains, building towards Deku and Shigaraki becoming arch-enemies in the vein of their mentors.<br />
<br />
While these two arcs excel due to their establishing a greater cast of villains and creating a sense of genuine threat, the following arc doesn&#039;t fare quite as well. The Provisional License Exam arc doesn&#039;t serve much purpose in the overarching plot other than to get the story from point A to point B. While there is some exploration of Todoroki&#039;s grudge against his father, this isn&#039;t anything we haven&#039;t already covered elsewhere. Ultimately, without it being as firmly rooted in the emotional journey of its characters, it has a lot less substance than the other arcs, and feels awkward and transitionary.<br />
<br />
This is exacerbated by some uncharacteristically bad pacing for this series, with two filler episodes sandwiched into it along with some added scenes and dialogue, presumably included to make sure that the season ended at a good point rather than smack in the middle of another arc.<br />
<br />
While one of the two filler episodes (technically three, but the first was a start-of-season recap) follows a similar idea to season 2&#039;s surprisingly good filler episode, in covering events that happened offscreen to secondary 1-A characters, the other is a completely unnecessary waste of time that accomplishes little more than plugging the movie. And even the better of the two fails to repeat the same success of season 2&#039;s filler, partially because while the previous one came as a breather episode inbetween story arcs, this one directly interrupted the plot in progress. It also doesn&#039;t help that Tsuyu is a better character than Yaoyorozu (fight me, nerds).<br />
<br />
The writing is also noticeably worse during filler, in particular for Uraraka and Bakugo. Uraraka gets a lot of screentime in additional scenes, but almost all of her dialogue in these scenes revolves around her uncertainty around her feelings for Deku, something we had already established and which didn&#039;t need repeating ad nauseam. Bakugo on the other hand plays up all his worst character traits in the movie-plugging filler episode, but where his recklessness in canon is usually due to his anger and frustration with Deku, here it&#039;s pure idiocy.<br />
<br />
Once the exam is over, however, the quality immediately picks back up. And whatever disservice the filler may have done for Bakugo, it&#039;s easily forgotten after he gets some long overdue character development. While Bakugo ws never a bad character, he wasn&#039;t a likeable one either. But Bakugo&#039;s character arc has been long in process - with his entire worldview being flipped on its head the moment Deku gained a quirk, Bakugo has been challenged with the thought that he&#039;s no longer superior to everyone around him - a belief that he had always taken for granted until then. This season finally takes this setup and brings it to a conclusion redeeming an oft-maligned character in the process.<br />
<br />
Overall, while the quality of this season does take a noticeable dip during the provisional license exam, even then it isn&#039;t bad - just underwhelming in comparison. Outside of this arc, it matches (and in places exceeds) the benchmark the previous season set.<br />
<br />
And for any mistakes the series may make, it still manages to retain investment in both the ever-evolving setting and its quirky (pun not intended) ensemble cast, the latter in particular benefiting not only from more character arcs, drama, and development, but from increased downtime letting us see more of these characters outside of their roles in the plot, fleshing out more of their personalities and character dynamics.<br />
<br />
With the series ending on a foreboding note, Hero Academia promises great things to come - but for now, Hero Academia 3 is an impressive, if uneven, entry in the series.<br />

    Superhero stories feels like it’s been populating the entertainment industry from these recent years. Marvel and DC successfully adapted many of these superhero tales with huge fanbases. The CW Network have aired shows with a large following like The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow. My Hero Academia always reminds me that it has a place with its own set of superheroes and villains. With that in mind, I was pretty ecstatic about the return of My Hero Academia.<br />
<br />
The third season does a bit of recapping at first to get viewers comfortable with its characters, story setting, and general concepts. As someone who has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290330">
        been following both the anime and manga, I knew what was to expect as the series is structured with story arcs. From the first half of the show, we follow Class 1-A as the first semester at U.A has concluded. Known as the “Forest Training Camp Arc”, it details the events of our young heroes participating in a training camp. They are supervised by a hero group known as the Pussycats but incidents happen that leads the arc into quite a chaos. It’s no surprise either as My Hero Academia likes to build tension and make story with its characters. From the Training Camp arc, we are introduced to a character named Kota who has a distasteful view towards heroes. The show explores his reasons for this while also adapts how he begins to change after meeting certain people. Enter Deku. He is pretty much symbolic for what Kota detests because of his values and desire to become a hero. The arc details of what it really means of being a hero and opening his eyes to reality.<br />
<br />
Moving on, it’s also clear that the series has dangerous adversaries for the heroes to face. The League of Villains has been teased from season 2 and in this season, they make themselves known with malicious intentions. Their core members exposes the dangers our heroes faces but they also have a hidden agenda. That brings into the question of a guy named Katsuki Bakugo. You’d remember him as the arrogant guy who always strives to be the best with a huge ego. From this season, you’ll also see what it means to be a hero from his point of view. Nonetheless, I think there may be an overemphasis on the idea of making heroes. Every episode and arc dedicates an immense amount of time to such concepts that sometimes, I wonder if there’s just too much. I say this because after a certain amount of episodes, the storytelling feels a bit redundant without much development. Heroism becomes too symbolic even in the case of All Might. On the contrary, one could also mention that All Might is a symbol of being a real hero. He represents courage, integrity, peace, and self-sacrifice. The apex of the show has him battle out against a powerful enemy from the past that draws out perhaps one of the most important episodes of the franchise. While still overemphasizing the idea of heroism, it’s significant enough to prove what being a hero is all about.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the series still has its sense of humor. There exists many moments in the show that offers to delivery comedy ranging from Mineta’s ridiculous perverted antics to an episode about checking out everyone’s rooms. Bringing back to the main plot, the second half of the show features the hero license exams and internship arc together. It now transcends from young heroes to take their next step in following their dreams. New characters are introduced while familiar ones are bought back together to add to the drama. It also adds bits of tense rivalry between certain characters that may or may not be pleasing to remember. But I must say, preparing these heroes in such a way feels like the pacing could have been improved. I’m not a big fan for the latter half of the show as most of those episodes didn’t make much of an impact. Even in terms of personal enjoyment, I find myself losing interest when watching Deku, Bakugo, Momo, Todoroki, Enji, Tenya, Ochaco, or others compete to earn their spot. Some of the new characters like Mei did occasionally spark my interest but nonetheless felt underwhelming. What about the new characters like the ones from Shiketsu High School? To me, they’re unique individually but lacks development and isn’t well crafted enough for true appeal. I’m not going to lie, it felt like the show sometimes has too many characters in a story arc at once and doesn’t really bring out their true potentials.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I guess you may be asking if character relationships develop further in this season. It definitely proves itself being able to capitalize on the complex relationship such as with Deku and Bakugo, Deku and All Might, or Deku and Koda. But for other characters like Ochaco, they really take a pitfall. There’s obvious romance that blooms from her towards Deku but the season acts more like a ship tease with no true hope of sailing sail. Never say never though, right? Just not this season.<br />
<br />
Coming back to this franchise definitely reminded of the Shounen Jump action I was looking for. A superhero action series like this isn’t complete without its colorful character cast and their action roles. It offers all sort of characteristics where every hero or villain is unique. However, it may be noticable that some episodes dropped in quality compared to previous seasons. Yoshihiko Umakoshi worked on a variety of roles from previous seasons ranging from character designs, chief animation director, and key animation. In this season, he’s absent as a role of animation director. That doesn’t mean the third season fell apart though because in some of the more climatic episodes, there’s definitely high quality animation. The explosiveness and energy of the fighting scenes from some of the more important episodes really are worth praising. There’s also the dynamic character motions with emotional content that adds more value to many scenes this season. There’s even environmental physics and other background animation that are worth paying attention to. To me, I think My Hero Academia Season 3 started off a bit slow but was able to work itself up again to bring these storybook characters to stardom. The familiarity of the soundtrack also brings together moments that you won’t forget. <br />
<br />
After three seasons of My Hero Academia, I think it’s safe to say that the momentum of this roller-coaster isn’t going to stop for a good while. Superhero shows often portray characters as exactly what they are – a symbol of justice and peace. While My Hero Academia does continue to follow that concept, it has moments that truly capitalizes on the meaning of this ideology. With more episodes on the way in the future, I still have bright hopes for this franchise.
