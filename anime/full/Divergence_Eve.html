    Now here&#039;s an oddity. I&#039;ve yet to see another series that mixes two conflicting extremes in quite such an inexplicable manner. Allow me to elaborate. <br />
<br />
A serious, gritty science fiction horror. A touch of space exploration, but mainly based in one frontier space station. A mildly convoluted, dense plot that&#039;s initially baffling but gradually clears while continuing to raise mysteries along the way. A touch of chronological confusion, with the first episode being set after most of the rest of the series. Some intrigue, some bleakness and paranoia, some strangeness and just a touch of the disturbing. <br />
<br />
With an almost all-female cast who all have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2592">
        breasts the size of their torsos. <br />
<br />
An oddity indeed. <br />
<br />
The thing that continues to confound me about Divergence Eve is how this happened. The simplest explanation would be that someone wrote a serious science fiction horror, then someone else came along and drew breasts on it. Quite often, a series tries to be two things at once, and fails at both; Divergence Eve doesn&#039;t TRY to be two things, it just seems to be two incompatible things haphazardly glued together - and succeeds at both, to an extent. Yes, where series that try hard to meld two elements fail, Divergence Eve succeeds by not making any effort to integrate them at all. Or rather, it succeeds at each one separately, but fails at both together. <br />
<br />
You see, if you want to watch impossibly proportioned anime girls bouncing around in impractical faux-military uniforms, getting out of showers and training in their underwear - Divergence Eve will meet your needs. If, on the other hand, you want to watch the aforementioned gritty and engrossing science fiction horror, complete with intrigue, mystery and suspense - Divergence Eve will meet your needs too. But in each case, you need to do your best to overlook the other element. If you want bouncing chests and so on, you may find the involved plot makes you think when you probably don&#039;t really want to, and distracts you from the eye candy. And if you want the plot - or get dragged into it against your will - the constant bouncing, jiggling and unprovoked bouts of nudity will grate. If you&#039;re willing to concentrate, you can take Divergence Eve on either of its component parts, but not both together. <br />
<br />
The series as a whole is reasonably nicely drawn and adequately animated. I don&#039;t think I need to say anything about the character designs (or point out where most of the animation happens) but it&#039;s worth mentioning the &#039;outside&#039; bits. Outside Watcher&#039;s Nest, the space station, everything goes CG. Sometimes this is really glaring, such as when a character and a CG object meet (which doesn&#039;t happen all that often, in fairness) but a lot of the time it works well enough. The Ghouls (which I won&#039;t explain, to avoid spoilers) are done in CG and seem a bit woodenly animated, but the CG spacecraft are pretty decent. It&#039;s not Advent Children, but it&#039;s good enough, and having the Rampart Armours (the characters&#039; individual transports in space) in CG actually lends them an oily, military solidity that fits with the tone of the plot. <br />
<br />
Some of the incidental music in this series is quite nice, though not outstanding. The opening theme is probably the musical highlight; a vaguely mechanical-sounding guitar-based chug at odds with the mildly fanservicey images it accompanies. The ending theme, though, is horrendous: a shrill, vacuous noise that can&#039;t be labelled &#039;pop&#039; without offending a great many people. It&#039;s awful even if taken alone and out of context, but when it comes immediately after a tense or ominous scene at the end of an episode, it&#039;s hideously jarring. At the end of each episode I leapt for the remote, and you will too - to hit either &#039;stop&#039; or &#039;mute&#039;, depending on whether you want to watch the full-on fanservice montage that is the end credits. <br />
<br />
Before we leave the realm of the audio, I&#039;ll mention the voice acting. I watched the dub (I usually do, unless it&#039;s bad enough to grate - Escaflowne, I&#039;m looking at you) so I can&#039;t comment on the Japanese voices, but the English ones are less annoying than you might imagine - and yet more annoying, too. Misaki, the main character, sounds like, for want of a better word, a bimbo. And she is, mostly. In that sense, I suppose the voice is appropriate, but bear in mind that she&#039;s meant to be a marine of sorts. Some of the other girls are a bit squeaky or whiny, but not unbearably so - and there&#039;s one solitary gem. My favourite voice actor in this is also my favourite character: the girls&#039; immediate superior, another generously proportioned woman by the name of Lyar von Ertiana, who defies the gravity of her chest and acquires some gravity of character. She&#039;s voiced by Shelley Calene-Black, who I later discovered again in Those Who Hunt Elves (and it turns out she&#039;s been in a few others too, such as Orphen) and while her performance isn&#039;t exceptional for anime in general, in this case she&#039;s the only one of the female characters to have any kind of strength or distinctive character in her voice. <br />
<br />
Now to the plot. I&#039;m not going to describe any of it, since I can&#039;t do so without spoilers, but I will say it&#039;s the strongest point of the series. It&#039;s interesting, fairly clever, dark, and engrossing - but I have a couple of significant criticisms. Firstly, it can be a little confusing. It&#039;s some time before anything becomes remotely clear, and you may find yourself going back to earlier episodes to see if they can help you make sense of a new development. Having said that, it&#039;s less confusing than the likes of RahXephon, so it&#039;s a surmountable problem. Secondly, the plot doesn&#039;t finish. I&#039;m not giving anything away by revealing that; I think it&#039;s best to go into this series knowing that if you want the rest of the plot you need to watch the sequel series, Misaki Chronicles. At least, I assume Misaki Chronicles actually wraps everything up; I haven&#039;t got round to watching it yet, out of sheer terror that it might have been completely overcome by fanservice. Either way, you won&#039;t find resolution in Divergence Eve. <br />
<br />
All in all, I&#039;d have to say I do like Divergence Eve and will probably watch it again sooner or later, but its flaws are too numerous to make it essential viewing. The acceptable but vaguely annoying voices, the occasionally jarring CG, the grotesquely inappropriate ending theme and the lack of plot resolution would knock this down a point or two anyway, but the most striking and downright inescapable of the faults in the series is the utterly baffling fanservice that pervades everything by way of the enormous, bouncy chests of all the female characters. This really scuppers the whole endeavour by contrasting completely with the tone of the story and forcing the viewer to squint or develop selective blindness in order to take any of it seriously. This jarring contrast is probably easier to resolve if you&#039;re only in it for the breasts; you can just press &#039;mute&#039; to avoid exposure to the plot. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame, really, because if it had stuck to being drama/horror instead of trying to tack on some Playboy elements, Divergence Eve would have been easy to recommend as a dark, interesting and pretty different take on science fiction anime.

    If you have contemplated on viewing this anime, a major caveat would be, avoid this anime and look elsewhere. Unless, you like extreme fan service than this may catch your fancy; however, you will lose interest regardless. The plot is very thin and will leave you at times confused and uninterested. Character designs are nothing to complain about, but the gravity-defying breasts distract you from taking the series seriously.  To an extent the characters are one-dimensional, even the main protagonist, misaki is explored profoundly in the series, but I just couldn&#039;t emphatize with the character; thus I couldnt really connect.<br />
<br />
The CG Mech battles were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2658">
        poorly executed and again, I was quickly reverted to a state of boredom.  The violent and graphics scene in this anime left me unmoved because as I stated before, it was difficult to connect to the characters.  The combination of ecchi, drama, and horror just wasnt compatible in this title and should be avoided.<br />
<br />
If you like thin plot lines and over-proportioned mammaries, then be my guest. Otherwise... stay away.

    Hello everyone, here&#039;s your friendly and happy girl RedHero speaking, here to review this anime series that... I don&#039;t even know what to even give this show credit for. The only thing I can give this series credit for is the fact that its so terrible, that even calling this series the word &quot;shit&quot; is a prime insult to every shitty anime available in the same exact medium. It&#039;s a series that I wasn&#039;t really expecting it to be too bad, considering that not that many people complained except for a few friends of mine nearby, that have experienced it. I thought they were overreacting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218742">
        to the fact that the show is bad. I tried to even enjoy it, but in actual reality, its an entirely piece of atrocity. Trust me, if you go and watch this series and survive like me, you&#039;re a saint and have survived pure dosage of poison. No wait, even giving poison is being too generous to this series. This anime is the complete definition of Ebola level of shittery, if anything it would give the person, even your dog a heart attack.<br />
<br />
So pretty much with this introduction I will go and start the review, but before that let me give you warnings:<br />
<br />
This is going to be based on my personal opinion, if you actually like the series, I won&#039;t judge you on that manner, I just really personally can&#039;t see anything that have made me feel like liking the series or its just not my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
The second warning, and the last warning, is that I will technically spoil and give brighter details about the show and why do I think this series is atrocious in its own way. And by that I will just focus on the story and the characters in a way. So if you don&#039;t want to get spoiled, I would suggest you to stay away from the review and watch the show yourself. If you don&#039;t want to, then read this review and don&#039;t touch the show at all.<br />
<br />
Without further warnings, let&#039;s get started... please, let me survive this.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story is pretty simple to explain. We pretty much got our main female protagonist, Misaki Kureha, going into this base or military station where she basically will go and become this military that will go and fight for the safety of the earth, by actually attacking these monsters called the &quot;Ghouls&quot;. At the same time, there&#039;s a thing going around with the main protagonist, which is basically connected to her father and the base itself, and the incident that happened long time ago. <br />
<br />
Basically the series is pretty much simple to explain with that, as the story goes to a backstory from Episode 2 to the finish line, considering that the first episode was basically a sort of apparent present timeline. I really don&#039;t know, things happened into the show that just brought in the present, and then onward towards the backstory.<br />
<br />
Now, what are the bad things about the series, if you may ask? I will say... a lot more than I can imagine with it. There were a lot of shit that happened within the show that makes me feel sick as fuck about it, even I can admit any other shitty show would have bad writing, but those shows are masterpieces compared to this anime.<br />
<br />
For starters, there&#039;s a lot of ways that really didn&#039;t worked from the beginning, mainly being the present timeline or the first episode. They tried to actually pull this for an introduction but instead, it just makes the writing feel and look like dogshit. Expecting to make me feel bad for an android just because she died from the apparent Shadow Ball from the Pokemon series, without me knowing two shits about her isn&#039;t a good idea. It just makes me feel cringe worthy throughout the entire show. <br />
<br />
There were other things wrong with the writing aspect of the series, example being the contradicting logic that the show displays that its really noticeable. <br />
<br />
For one example the Leader also known as the Black Ugly Man (thats what I will call him from now on, and Im sorry if I am being racist here) actually said in one of the episodes that he would want to save these girls from actual danger, so basically that&#039;s gonna be it, right? Wrong, he then said in another scene that he would want to protect the ship than helping the girls out. Isn&#039;t that really a very noticeable flaw here? You basically said that you will help the girls but then you suddenly don&#039;t want to because you want to protect the base. Either way, YOU WILL TECHNICALLY DIE REGARDLESS. <br />
<br />
Another thing is that the Gray Hair girl, which was technically in charge of the cadets, really didn&#039;t knew how to act properly, she then ignores the fact that some of the girls are in danger, and then she realizes it after a few minutes, and even the girls were telling her this shit. That&#039;s really bad for a person in charge of the cadets do that type of stuff. That&#039;s really an example of how to not write a person in charge of her subordinates.<br />
<br />
And another thing would be when the girls were going towards an apparent mall, and they disregard the fact that the ghoul would come out at any moment in the episode, and the before people tells me &quot;But Red, maybe they didn&#039;t knew that the Ghoul would be coming towards the hologram city.&quot; They did told the girls that a Ghoul would be around at any moment. So what the fuck is this shit? It doesn&#039;t make any sense in terms of writing neither the execution. And even if they knew, they shouldn&#039;t be acting like nothing bad will happen either. They&#039;re basically retards.<br />
<br />
Another issue is that there were major plot holes into the series that doesn&#039;t really make sense, causing me to actually lose my brain.<br />
<br />
Example being that the girls were at training camp or area, trying to train their skills and experiences, but friendly reminder that in the previous episodes, they stated that the helmets that they use are for hallucinations and holograms of what they actually see. So, when they didn&#039;t had their helmets on, they can still see that shit and the funny thing is that there&#039;s no actual screen in that area. This doesn&#039;t make sense in the writing aspect of the show. How in the fucking hell can they see the trombones when they don&#039;t have their helmets on?<br />
<br />
And here is my other problem with this as well. During one of the episodes, the girls were actually on a test regarding on the data passing with the helmets. They literally sent the girls to the outside of the base, disregarding the fact that they have the entrance of the ghouls halfway opened. And disregarding the fact that they also knew the Ghoul was coming made it worse on that aspect. Also, why in the fuck did they mentioned that the Ghouls that the show had were a hologram in that exact same episode? If that was the case, then they shouldn&#039;t have worried about the girls in the damn first place and rise up the over-dramatic scene, it makes it rather poorly executed and also that shows the example of poor writing. And if it wasn&#039;t a hologram, then they are complete retards because they ignored the fact that they had the entrance halfway opened and they knew that the entrance was halfway opened. And no, they didn&#039;t even tried to fix the stuff to begin with.<br />
<br />
Also apparently the main male character introduced who saw the apparent robots scene has got to have his memories erased (as explained later on in the show, if either the person sees something that nobody else could see, and doesn&#039;t keep the promise, or quits the military, their memories are erased), so they basically putted the main male character to the state of deleting the memories of those events, which they then explained they will erase the memories from 2 years prior. But for some god damn reason, once they finished the entire process of deleting the memories of the main character, HE STILL REMEMBERS THESE EVENTS of the Robots and this shows that they contradicted what they just explained in the series later on. How in the fuck could he be able to remember this? How in the hell did he even survived that? It doesn&#039;t make sense at all. It just makes this a even bigger plot hole, especially when in one of the episodes later on after that they showed an example of what would happen if they breaks one of the two established rules.<br />
<br />
Another issue the series has is that it really takes itself very seriously with the story department. Alright, before I go ahead and say this, many shows does the same thing, but at least those shows I&#039;ve seen that are shit at least they are trying too hard in a way that it&#039;s entertaining as well, and its a good way to make the show somehow tolerable enough. For example, Mirai Nikki is a prime example of an edgy story telling, but its really bad in a way that it&#039;s entertaining due to the way it handles it, that it feels fun to watch. It&#039;s a good idea for the anime because while it would be considered bad, I do say that it&#039;s bad that it&#039;s entertaining to watch from my end.<br />
<br />
This show however takes itself too seriously, to the point where it leads to awful portrayed drama, a poorly executed plot because of the plot points not being explained at all, and along with the sense of braindead logic as well, terrible pull for fanservice, and more.<br />
<br />
Especially when the information dumping and the story as a whole is written by a 2 year-old manchild who&#039;s basically starting his/her career for writing stories. It&#039;s awful in a way that I really cannot comprehend the logic into the show, and the sense of trying to even understand the show with such poorly handled aspects.<br />
<br />
As for the drama I will say this is by far the worst drama I have ever seen, that even Charlotte is better than this series in a way. They go to this single-handed over dramatic tension where it feels like the characters aren&#039;t being dramatic naturally, it just feels forced as hell and it really isn&#039;t a good way to make someone feel bad for the character. For example, in one of the few episodes, they dedicate the entire episode forcing on people&#039;s throats on this drama about the main character&#039;s struggles, but I really can&#039;t take the drama when the show&#039;s drama is being rekt by calming atmosphere all of the sudden, and then in the other episodes, the drama feels overly forced just because of a terrible incident, that even I cringed over the fact that the main female character is over dramatizing everything. <br />
<br />
The comedy scenes and the serious scenes do not work together as explained previously with the entire taking itself seriously here. The show in itself with the comedy jokes and the slice of life areas, along with the serious moments being executed falls rather flat and rather breaking itself more every way. It doesn&#039;t work because you cannot just put a joke during a serious moment.<br />
<br />
Finally here comes the best part of the series. The over-sexualized as hell, overly-portrayed fanservice in every place of the anime series. I thought the ecchi/harem genres would be just bad in a sense, but this went on a whole new level of fanservice out of place. In comparison to every other LN with the ecchi/harem genre, these are masterpieces compared to this shit. The fanservice are so out of place more than that, and it just takes away every little tension and seriousness this series would have. Every single second of it is full of blatantly placed fanservices. And before you guys say &quot;But Red it&#039;s suppose to be an ecchi series, what do you expect?&quot; Friendly reminder that this series does not have the ecchi tag, so that shit is completely invalid from my end. And it wouldn&#039;t be too bad if they haven&#039;t place them on. At least in ecchi/harems you already know its going to have SOME ecchi, this doesn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
In the end, the story is one of the few aspects I covered that were bad, there&#039;s more to it, but in short, the story department is one of the worst aspects of the show, with no sense of logical thinking, with a lot of contradictions to what they say, towards the try-hard presentation of themes, the comedy being completely unfunny and cringe worthy, at the same time out of place, plot-hole fest, retarded writing that even calling it retarded writing is being too generous to this, fanservice all over the place like no tomorrow, and an insult even towards the mecha genre.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Oh boy, this will be a little bit short, but at the same time I have a lot of things to talk about this department.<br />
<br />
This is where the shit makes itself even shittier, with bland, uninteresting, unrealistic, unrelatable, completely idiotic characters, to the peak where I have never thought seeing terrible characters in such a very awful manner.<br />
<br />
All of these characters, and including the main female character and its supporting characters, are all one-dimensional, unrealistic and pretty much retarded characters I have ever seen, that even other series can handle retardation to an extent.<br />
<br />
Just like on the story department explained, I did clarified that the characters are pretty much idiotic in their own brains that they can&#039;t even think for themselves or even think of a better idea to even give an order. But there is more to that just being idiotic, there are loads of issues that makes me pretty much cringe worthy.<br />
<br />
The main female character, Misaki Kureha, is by far one of the most unrelatable characters I have ever seen, but not only that, but one of the most over-dramatic, under-developed, and at the same time one of the most unrealistic characters I can even imagine. Her character is a prime example of how to not write a main protagonist, by making her extremely untolerable and outright contagiously ignorant, and then forcing the backstory just to make the audience feel sympathy towards her. Thats not how you write a character or make me feel bad for her in any type of fiction or literature. For me to feel bad for her you have to make me like her first, and this fails phase 1 of what the series is trying to do. The backstory seems forced that in the end it became useless because she never really develops from it, neither after the scene in episode 10 at all. It feels unrealistic and poorly done of a character, that I just can&#039;t really mention anymore of here.<br />
<br />
Next we have the one and only Luxandra, also known as the plot device of the entire show. She had no type of character development whatsoever that she&#039;s basically used as a doll to give the character some development, but in the end all she was used for was to cause this over-dramatic scene that it feels just as cringey as the 50 Shades of Grey drama.<br />
<br />
Next we have Suzanna, also used as a plot device in a sense, because she was basically used just to reveal this apparent backstory or reveal that Kureha&#039;s memories cannot be erased, by obviously erasing Suzanna&#039;s memories as a way or portraying or showing an example, and this caused the contradiction of the main male character&#039;s memories being apparently erased began.<br />
<br />
Lastly we have the girl who was literally used as a plot device to cause some havoc in one of the episodes, Kotoko, the Kotoko class android. This character was nothing more than a empty shell of a human body, used as a plot convenience in order to cause a problem and unneeded drama around the show.<br />
<br />
Also another one, supporting characters wise, I will note a few that really are either useless or just basically retarded.<br />
<br />
The main male character also known as Bernard, has got to be one of the pussiest and useless male characters I have ever seen any form of fiction, because he&#039;s basically used as a plot device as well, just to basically drive the main female character into this plot convenient narrative and a plot convenient progression in order of in the end, being killed by the fucking sassy fucker. He was useless because he never really helped much into the issue, and it was worse when he was foreshadowed as the bad guy when in the end he&#039;s just basically fodderized by a bigger fodder. It&#039;s just awful. <br />
<br />
The Big tits girl that I don&#039;t remember is only used as a character to basically help the sassy fucker, and sassy fucker pretty much does nothing but to drag the entire show into such awful theme exploration.<br />
<br />
In short, these are basically one of the worst cast of characters that I have ever seen, and they&#039;re really this retarded in a sense that they contradict, are useless, most of them are basic plot devices, and nothing more than that.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
<br />
Ever heard of the time when you have your first project, and it has to do with basic power point presentations and just copy and paste the entire shit and the pictures included, and adding slideshows to make it look neat and clean? This is the entire show&#039;s art and animation quality.<br />
<br />
The Art and Animation Quality looks really bad for the base of the decade that it was basically airing, and it looks very pale, shadings are out of place, and at the same time the art color palettes are weak and lazily done as hell.<br />
<br />
The polishing for the artwork is not noticeable, the artstyle looks pretty badly standard but then it looks so unnatural, and it looks like the basic definition of the color poop.<br />
<br />
The characters are just basically looking like walking sticks in the worst way possible, and at the same time what makes this shit worse, is the CGI.<br />
<br />
Actually, CGI shouldn&#039;t be described for this series, they&#039;re just your stereotypical plastic toys that the kids can buy in an old shop, even the movements are like based out of toy models. It&#039;s so stale, and so choppy as well, especially with the Ghouls. But the Ghouls are basically worse because they look horrible as fuck, that it gives me basic nightmares. Hell, Chaos Dragon&#039;s or AntiMagic&#039;s CGI are fucking masterpieces compared to this shit&#039;s CGI, at least they don&#039;t look so horrific to the point that I wanna commit seppuku.<br />
<br />
And as for the animation, pretty choppy, awful, and badly directed. It&#039;s just your bad animations smoking cocaine and lost their eyesight basically, making this seem more like a laughing stock instead. Except it wasn&#039;t a laughing stock for me because I cringed at the animation quality.<br />
<br />
And I know the next excuse for this. &quot;But Red, this looks so god damn old, why are you bashing an old show base upon the artstyle?&quot; Friendly reminder as well, that this series was made in 2003-2005. And this is coming from the same studio that made the most critically acclaimed good show on their lineup, Haibane Renmei. That show was made in fucking 2002, and that show looks so well appealing and well designed than this series. So that excuse is technically weak in that sense, not to mention that in that decade a lot of series started to look more appealing than this.<br />
<br />
In the end I don&#039;t really have much to say here, in the end its a poorly cheap animated series, with shitty CGI, and a lot of shitty animation directing.<br />
<br />
Music/Sound/Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
I will say this in short for every single one of these things to keep this thing short. Every single one of these things are cringe worthy, untolerable, unfitting, or just unmemorable.<br />
<br />
The music is just so out of place that it really makes me wanna go and hit on the person that composed the music, because it was so horribly made and so badly composed that my ears were getting a massive shoving rape dose on, and then as for the sound effects it just makes me bleed of course.<br />
<br />
The voice acting in the Japanese dub isn&#039;t really too bad, but its not really noted as memorable or noticeable, although, I did watched one of the episodes dubbed, and seriously, this is by far the worst dub I have ever heard in my entire life. It even beats Mirai Nikki or Aldnoah Zero&#039;s dub in comparison, and that&#039;s saying something. It&#039;s cringe worthy to the soul and I didn&#039;t bothered watching more of it dubbed afterwards.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
The only enjoyment I got was the fact that I will say from experience, I letted my friend enjoy the daily dose of entertainment, just because he was watching Mayoiga (by the time of this review) in return for me. That was the only enjoyment I got, letting the other person hear my cries and screams because I wanted to see him react to Mayoiga. Aside from some of the times of reactions, the times where I was alone I was crying my eyes out every single way, in every single god damn episode. It really doesn&#039;t happen a lot, it made me cringe so bad that it felt like I was dying on the insides, everything was basically like a broken piano for me, every little bit of it was atrociously made, that I can&#039;t recommend this even to my worst enemy.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
This is by far the worst piece of dogshit I have ever witnessed as an anime watcher. It&#039;s so shit, that even giving the show&#039;s label as shit is being too generous at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
At least Mirai Nikki even though it was bad, it was highly entertaining.<br />
<br />
At least Diabolik Lovers was just shit but it wasn&#039;t too bad when you think about the time that you&#039;re wasting.<br />
<br />
At least Green Green was bad but it knew that it was basically retarded.<br />
<br />
At least Aldnoah.Zero and Sword Art Online had better writing than this.<br />
<br />
At least even Mars of Destruction and Skelter Heaven were abysmal, but they were just OVAs.<br />
<br />
AT LEAST EVEN THE NARUTO FILLERS WERE FUCKING MASTERPIECES COMPARED TO THIS SHIT.<br />
<br />
At least every single shitty anime available is better than this fucking piece of shit of an anime, that its the definition of everything bad in anime incarnated. Trust me, it&#039;s really that bad, even Boku no Pico can be better than this trash heep.<br />
<br />
In the end, if you wanna see how bad it is and see the actual poison it can give you, go and check it out. But if you survive this shit, you deserve a fucking medal for this one.<br />
<br />
In the end, I give this series a fucking 0/10, I despise it with a passion, and I declare it as one of the most dogshit animes I have ever seen in my entire life, if anything, THE WORST IN ITS MEDIUM.<br />

    Divergence Eve aired in 2003. It was created by Tsukumo Takumi and produced by Radix before the studio shut down in 2006. I don&#039;t know what to expect from it. I&#039;ve never reviewed a Radix work before. The only Radix production I&#039;m even vaguely familiar with is Amazing Nurse Nanako and, I have to say, that does not inspire confidence. But that also came out three-four years before this one and most studios have their good and bad moments. So, let&#039;s see if Divergence Eve is worth looking into.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open with a group of buxom women, and one flat-chested android, being briefed before getting sent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197120">
        in robot mechs to fight some kind of bizarre CG monster. We see one, Misaki, in some kind of pod attached to a bunch of cables while also being on the battlefield, somehow. Then the version of her on the battlefield turns into its own CG monster form and they both explode. It&#039;s at this point that you start wondering if this is a sequel to something since there seems to be a lot going on that you&#039;ve just been dropped into. The next episode takes us back in time where four cadets, Misaki, Luxandra, Suzanna &amp; Kiri are being sent to some kind of space station to join a military force s potential replacements for its retiring Commander. We then spend all the episodes except for the very last one getting to the point where we started.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about non-linear story telling for a moment, shall we? In a good non-linear story there are plenty of sources of tension that might get hinted at, but won&#039;t be spoiled and there&#039;s a compelling reason why they story works better when told in a non-linear fashion. A perfect example is the classic novel, Catch-22. There&#039;s also A Prayer for Owen Meany. Even Venus Versus Virus managed to use its non-linear elements decently. So, with that in mind let&#039;s look at what this series accomplishes by putting the twelfth episode chronologically at the beginning. It successfully destroys all sense of tension in the series. That&#039;s basically it. The main attempts at tension throughout the series are the mystery surrounding just what kind of mysterious power Misaki has that these shady scientists are interested in. Which we already know involves turning into a giant CG monster so that plot line quickly becomes very stale and predictable. They also try to have tension involving whether Misaki will survive various scenarios and whether she&#039;ll stay with the team when she considers quitting. But we already know that she&#039;ll live and stay with them because we saw her in the first episode, which takes place after all of this stuff. It isn&#039;t even tense about whether or not her comrades will survive since we see most of the ones who are going into danger in that first episode, alive and well. They also try to have an emotional moment involving the death of a character. Except that they talked about her being dead in the first episode so you were expecting it by the time it happens and it does nothing.<br />
<br />
The gross misuse of non-linear narrative isn&#039;t all that&#039;s wrong with the story telling in this either. The pacing is awful. We get long stretches where nothing of value happens and a bunch of pointless flashbacks that are there solely to give you information that you already know or to spell out information that was already obvious. They just assume their audience is a bit thick and needs the help. The ending is also pretty rubbish. I will say, to Divergence Eve&#039;s credit, there are some concepts with potential here. If the execution was competent they could have led to some decent stuff.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters in this are a group of stock tropes without much in terms of originality,personality or development. They aren&#039;t the worst group of characters. None of them are egregiously annoying or anything like that. They&#039;re just a boring group.<br />
<br />
I do want to talk a bit about the character death that they spoil in the first episode. It is a really bad idea to open a new series telling you that a certain character will die. Not just because it lessens the impact, but because it&#039;s really difficult to get the audience invested in a character when they know that they aren&#039;t going to last. It certainly requires better writing than is on display here. You want to give your audience time with that character and reasons to care about them. A good example is the excellent western cartoon Beast Wars. They pretty heavily foreshadow a particular character&#039;s death and it culminates in the greatest episode of any Transformers series ever, Code of Hero. But by the time the foreshadowing starts you know this character really well, he may even be your favourite character. You have the investment and that gives the scene impact. In this, you know the character is going to die before you&#039;ve heard her speak and the series does nothing to develop her. As such, you don&#039;t bother getting invested in her and her eventual demise means nothing.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
You may remember last October when I talked about the Galerians OVA and its CG artwork that looked like it was from an early Playstation title. Divergence Eve suffers from a similar problem. They use CG artwork for the monsters, action sequences and some tech shots and it&#039;s roughly on par with the CG in Galerians. It&#039;s awkward, stiff, blocky and just looks laughably ludicrous. Although, this series has plenty of scenes that use more traditional animation too. Incidentally, there is a major problem with those scenes as well. Namely that this series is almost as bad about shamelessly using exploitative fan-service as Highschool of the Dead was. The female characters, save the android, look almost Liefeldian in their proportions. They have massively over-sized bosoms and overly thin waists that don&#039;t look like they could house internal organs. They aren&#039;t quite as bad as Liefeld&#039;s abominations, though. Since they have pupils and don&#039;t constantly stand awkwardly on their tip toes.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Radix did get some talented actresses for this. Kakazu Yumi (the voice of Yuffie and Aizawa Mint) takes the lead as Misaki. We&#039;ve also got Kiuchi Reiko, Koyasu Takehito, &amp; Kobayashi Sanae among others. But this is one of those series where they don&#039;t have much to work with so the characters sound pretty generic in spite of the talent behind them. The music is also pretty mediocre.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There might be a bit. It&#039;s hard to judge because the character interactions are so listless. The girls certainly spend more time with each other than they do with any blokes and they seem to like each other more. There&#039;s also a line from Suzanna that may indicate that she has romantic feelings for Misaki.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Divergence Eve is tripe. It&#039;s a bad action series that had some good ideas that they didn&#039;t feel like doing anything interesting with. The artwork is pretty awful, the characters are dull and any story moments that could have had an impact are ruined by the baffling way they elected to make the story non-linear and butchered the execution. That being said, I have seen a lot worse. It&#039;s bad, certainly, but it&#039;s not horrible. As such, My final rating is a 3/10. It&#039;s kind of sad because I had a bit of a combo going with three good anime, Death Parade, Nanoha A&#039;s &amp; Love Live, in a row. Next week I&#039;ll look at Ice. So, that should be good fun for everybody. Although, I haven&#039;t started it yet so it may very well turn out to not be fun for me. We&#039;ll see how that works out.
